unknown:

a number

known:

incoming stream of numbers

condition:

number is always 50% biggest of the stream

Auxiliary problems: dropping some of the conditions, in this case the median requirment

reductio ad absurdum:

1. how to keep track of max value of this stream => keep update that value for each number we see

2. how to keep track of max 10 values of this stream => keep updating the 10 value collection

3. how to keep track of max 10% values of this tream => keep updating the 10% value collection, notice that as more number coming in , we need promote some numbers from the lower 90% to 10%

=> insight: we need to dynamically update BOTH high and low collecitons, and keep track of all of them!

Which data structure is good at modification?

1. linked list => but cant bsearch on it to quickly identify insertion place

2. stack/queue => not obvious

3. balanced BST => This could work, fast insertion/deletion + fast retrival => notice that each time we have a new number, we need to compare it with the min value of top 10%,i.e., we need fast access to min/max value

=> we can use a specialized cousin of BST,i.e., heap
