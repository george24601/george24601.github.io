unknown:
max size of package

known:
input sequence

condition:
all items in a package must be different from each other
package is from a sequential segment

From unknown:
what defines package is its starting index, after that, we just need to scan the subsequence

sub-problem:
suppose I know the start index, how to tell the size of package?

just start form the index, the first duplicate encountered will mark it off => i.e. we need a set

sub-problem:
after we seal one package, what the next start index to try?

It should be the index AFTER the first occurence of duplicate. Since anything between duplicate index and start index gives a smaller size


sub-problem:
after we decide the next start index, what is the next index to inspect?

the one after the duplicate one. The current state of the subsequence can be obtained if we just take out everything between the duplicate index and start index from the set
