Intuition: if f(a) >= f(b), then k(a) <= k(b) so that total # is minimized 

Proof: Suppose there exists f(a) >= f(b), and k(a) > k(b), swapping the key of a and b will reduce the total #. Thus, we can repeat the
process and keep reducing the total #,i.e., an arrangement satifies the condition is better than all arrangments not satisfying the
condition, this means the condition is optimal


Pseudocode

    sort the frequency, from high to low
    curIndex = 0
    total = 0
    depth = 1
    
    while(curIndex < L)
      if (curIndex + K < L)
        total += K * depth
      else
        total += depth * (L - curIndex)
        
      curIndex += K
      depth++
