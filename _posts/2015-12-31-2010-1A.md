Rotate
----
Code up rotate routine, and then detect win conditions for horionzal, vertical, and diagonal

Pseudo code for rotate

```
  for col from 0 to n - 1
    oldCol = n - 1
    oldRow = n - col - 1
    for row from n -1 to 0
      while(oldCol >= 0 && old[oldRow][oldCol] == '.')
        oldCol--;

      if (oldCol >= 0)
        new[row][col] = old[oldRow][oldCol]
```

Pseudo code for check

```
  for row from 0 to n -1
    for col from 0 to n - 4 
      color = new[row][col];
      if (color == '.')
        continue;
      for i from 1 to 3
        if '.' or color, go to next col
```


Make it smooth
----

  1. If an array is smooth, all subarrays must be smooth

  2. However, reverse can not be said to be true, because the ends of two smooth subarries may have too huge difference => we need to include the actual number as well!

  3. You will never delete and then insert, or vice versa, never insert and update, never update and delete, never update and update, because
compress them into 1 step can only save cost. i.e., if we have a list of final ops, the order of applying them does not matter, because there is no dependency between steps

  4. Suppose we have a smooth subarray from 1 to n, with end value v. to make i+1 smooth with end value v1. change the value of a[i+1] to match smoothness range of subarray a[i] 

  5. Note we do not attempt to change a[i], because a different end value for position i would cover this case already.

  6. To change a[i+1] to a specific value v, we can either delete and then insert, or do a plain update. We will pick the min choice.
  

Pseudo code

```
  Speical case i = 1, only deletion and insertion vs update case

  for i = 2 to N
    for tailVal = 0 to 255
      for newTailVal = 0 to 255
        cost[i][newTailVal] = convertCost(a[i], newTailVal, tailVal) + cost[i - 1][tailVal]
```
      
Now we need to design convertCost(fromV, toV, tailVal)

  1. If toV is within the M range of tailVal
    we either delete fromV and then insert toV, or update fromV, which ever is cheaper

  2. Otherwise, toV is outside M range of tailVal.
      if toV > tailVal,
        total cost = convertCost(fromV, toV - M, tailVal) + insertion cost
      else if toV < tailV
        total cost = convertCost(fromV, toV + M, tailVal) + insertion cost

The key insight here is that in induction, we limit our steps as much as we can to help discover insight, so long as our # of states will not cause
stack overflow problem. But we can compress the +/- into a multiple of Ms to reduce # of states

Number Game      
-------
Note that Each step is similar to gcd calculation

Consider the special case: where A,B are co-prime => turns out useless

Consider the simple case, and try to reduce to that case, and w.l.g, assume A > B. Note that state is symmetric along the diagonal

  1. B< A <= 2 * B, and the next step must be (A -B, B), i.e., state(A, B) = !state(A-B, B)
    when B < A <= 2 * B. 

  2. A > 2 * B, state(A,B) is winning if any of (A-B ....A-KB, B) is losing while A-KB > 0, and it is losing if ALL of (A-B...A-KB, B) are winning if A-KB > 0. But
there must exist j s.t. B <= A-j * B <= 2 * B, i.e., we can try both state(A -j *B, B) and state(A - j* B -B, B). But by 1), one of them is
losing, and one of them is winning, i.e., A can not lose!

  3. Consider A = B, it is a losing state, since we have to reach 0 ourselves

  4. A < B is same as case 1 and 2

I failed to solve the large case, which involves Fibonacci number and golden ratio
