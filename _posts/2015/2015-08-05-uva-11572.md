unknown:
max size of package

known:
input sequence

condition:
all items in a package must be different from each other
package is from a sequential segment

From unknown:
what defines package is its starting index, after that, we just need to scan the subsequence

invent a problem with similar unknown. What other data appropriate to determin unknown? =>

suppose I know the start index, how to tell the size of package?

just start form the index, the first duplicate encountered will mark it off => i.e. we need a set

swap unknown with part of data
where does the next package, which could potenitally be bigger than the current one, start?

It should be the index AFTER the first occurence of duplicate. Since anything between duplicate index and start index gives a smaller size

sub-problem:
after we decide the next start index, what is the next index to inspect?

the one after the duplicate one. The current state of the subsequence can be obtained if we just take out everything between the duplicate index and start index from the set


Cost:

Since our points always move forward and next backwoard. Overall cost will be linear
