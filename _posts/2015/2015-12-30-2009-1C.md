All Your Base
------
Insight:

  1. If digits are fixed, then the base should be as small as possible, to the point of larget digit + 1

  2. If base is fixed, then the first digit should be 1, and second 0, and third 2..

  3. Special case: only 1 digit

Pseudo code

    base = the number of unique digits
    create a map
    first char -> 1
    for i = [1, n)
      if digit does not exists in map, 
        map[char] = map.count or 0 if map.count == 1
      digit  = map[char]

    translate digits into the base



Center of Mass
---------
Consider only the 2 dimesnion case

only 1 firefly: distance toward a single line

2 fireflies: 

  both x and y are fully determined by time of inspection t. i.e., 
  xC= fX(t), yC = fY(t), and both fX(t) and fY(t) are linear functions. 

Therefore, yC can be resolved into a linear function of xC
in a closed form. i.e., we can reduce the 2 fireflies case into our simplistic case

Same argument applies to 3 dimension case


Bribe the Prisoners
------
Translate the requirement: find the order of release the prisoners such that # of coins paid

Swap unknown and known: suppose we release first prisoner. It becomes 2 segments, each of which will represent the original problem

i.e., 

  max(start, end)
    if(start == end)
      return 0;

    releaseHead = 1 + max(start+1, end)
    releaseTail = 1+ max(start, end -1)

      For i = start + 1 to end -1
        releaseMiddle = max(start, i) + max(i+2, end) + 2  

    it would be the min of all choices
