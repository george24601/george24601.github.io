title: "My Reading List for Distributed Systems"
description: " "
category: 
tags: [classic, papers]
---

Criteria
-------
```
  1. Classic enough to make it to the morning papers
  
  2. DIRECTLY related to my work, e.g., systems I use, designs I have to evaluate myself. So that learning can have an immediate feeedback, and thus lasting impact. This also means this list is intentionally INCOMPLETE

  3. Introduce theory only as means to de-mystify blackboxes, i.e., aiming at practitioners. This means I will skip a lot of important theoractical papers

```

The order of reading matters here! I try to topologically sort them based on dependency.
