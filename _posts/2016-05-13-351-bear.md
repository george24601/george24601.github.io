I saw basic insights, but my final algorithm is not correct, because it is not optimal.


```
  1. you need some min # of edges to form 2 pathes, but what is that min #?

  2. assume a path from A to B exists, and we know C and D has to be on that path

  3. Since all postions are relative, we can force a path like A->C.....->D->B. The claim is that if a solution exists, a solution with our
force order must also exist. and since our path is a solution itself. This iff means we just need to construct a solution from from our
forced path

  4. since A, B are not termnials any more, one additional must come out of A, one additional edge must enter B

  5. Since A, B are not connected, those two edges must be distinct

```

Here is my mistake I made during contest. I realize that the solution is symmetry, so the two edges other end point must be sort of symmetry
as well, so I assigned 2 points, 1 for C, and 1 for D.

However, I did not realize that symmetry needs only 1, i.e., i just need to assign ONE point where these 2 additional edges meet!

As a result, my algorithm passed sample, but failed pretest
