  1.Definition of partial ordering

  2.if C(a) > C(b), can I say a â†’ b? Why or why not?

  3.How the partial order maintained during processes and send/receives?

  4.How is total order defined based on partial order?

  5.Why the paper says total order is not defined only by the system of events?

  6.Describe the distributed sync problem

  7.Why a central process alone approach will work?

  8.Describe the distributed sync algorithm and its assumptions?

  9.Why do we need physical time to detect failure?

  10.What is the "anomalous behavior"? What are the 2 solutions proposed by the paper?

  11.Why the strong clock condition physical lock only sets forwards?
