Notice that each node has exaclty 1 out edge. The graph would be a tree, with children pointing to the parent, and root pointing to some
random child

Also notice that this n node, n edge is composable structure, so potentially there are multiple components

Now assume only 1 component in the graph.

The graph can be broken down into 2 parts

```
  1. a directed cycle
  
  2. directed trees with roots on that cycle

```

Proof: Induction on the number of vertices, when we add a new edge, which node should it point to?

```
  1. if it points to a vertex on the cycle, it has 3 choices, no incoming edge, incoming edge from cycle, incoming edge from tree

  2. If it points to a vertex on the tree, these 3 choices either introduce more branches, or break the old cycle and introduce a new one


```

Now if the component is just a cycle, then any subset would do => 2^n

If the component is cycle + branch, either empty set, or some edges from branches AND some edges from cycles => 1 + (2^|size of cycle| - 1)
* (2^|size of branch edges| -1) 

Now lets consider the multiple component cases

```
  1. for each component, the argument above still holds, because of the n vertice, n edges structure is composable, except that we have to
exclude empty set case, because each component needs to contribute something to the n node

  2. Therefore, the total # of ways is the product of each indiviual componenets ways - 1 (-1 to exclude empty set case)

```
