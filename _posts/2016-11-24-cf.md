53C:  Little Frog
---------
n = 3, 1 -> 3 -> 2

n = 4, 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

n = 5, 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3

The pattern is obvious now


717C: Potions Homework
---------
Sort the student by laziness

Claim: the optimal is achieved when lowest lazyness is paired with highest difficlutiles 

Proof: Exchange proof. Suppose we have l1 < l2 and d1 < d2, we can improve the solution by pair l1 with d2 and l2 with d1 

l1 * d1 + l2 * d2 - l1 * d2 - l2 * d1 = (l2 - l1)  * (d2 - d1) > 0


12C: Fruits
----------
Sort the fruits by numbers

Max total =  max # of fruit is most expensive

Min total = min # of fruite is most expensive

Exchange proof, note that the swap works for both ways


616C: The Labyrinth
---------
Flood fill on each passable cells, for each passible cell assign the component number, and then for each wall, get the set of its neighbor
component numbers and add up


635A: Orchestra
-------
Calculate n(r, c) = number of vs in the rectangle with bottom right corner at (r, c), note that n(i, 0) = 0, and n(0, i) = 0

n(r, c) =  n(r-1, c) + n(r, c-1) - n(r-1, c-1)

Then brute force on all (prevTop, prevLeft, br, rc) combos, find all combons such that n(br, rc) - n (prevTop, rc) - n(br, prevLeft) +
n(prevTop, prevLeft), note that prevTop < br and prevLeft < rc
