700A: As Fast As Possible
-----------
I failed to solve this problem during contest. I thought the bus had to take students to the end and then head back

Insights
--------

  1. To be able to minimize the time, all students should arrive at the same time. Otherwise, the bus could have headed back earlier and
helped the slowest one

  2. Since input is 10k max, we can do a bsearch on number. Because we have the insight 1), the related search would be the final time every
one arrives. Note that our epsilon is 10^-6

  3. Because each group arrive on the same time, and v1, v2 are constatnt, that means each group spend on the bus for the same amount of time. This furthur suggests the time spent to meet the bus heading back is same across all groups 

  4. Therefore, we can calculate by multiplication, how much time bus has been running, and as long as bus run can conclude within t, the answer is possible

Remember to setprecision to display required number of precisions


645A: Amity Assessment
--------
The DFS-state approach is too complex to code for this problem. For this problem, we notice that no matter how we move, the relative
clockwise order of tiles remain same. 

Therefore, it is enough just to form a 3 element string from inputs (minus the x), and see if we can rotate the from to form to


592C: The Big Race
---------
If it will be a tie if, L is within the range of (i* lcm(w, b), i* lcm(w, b) + min(w, b))

So total # = (t / lcm(w, b) - 1)  * min(w,b) +  min(w,b) - 1 + tailBand

Note that need to handle the case where min(w, b) > T
