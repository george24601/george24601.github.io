Idea 1: Simulation (messy !!!)
--------
```
	1. Find the leftmost > 4 digit after the decimal point

	2. from that digit to the left, try apply the rounding until we run out of time

	3. propagate the carry all the way to the leading digit.

```

This approach works, but it is very messy to implement, espeically mixing the rounding and carrying in the same loop


Idea 2: DP
---------
```
	Claim: the final solution is eqivalent of find a prefix of the number, and add 1 to that number, if any rouding is possible

	Proof: by induction, when t = 1, obviously. When t > 1, the carry happens at the digit to the left, so we will not increase the same digit twice, instead, we just move to the left

```

Therefore, we just need to find the prefix to apply the +1 step. This means we need to calculate the minimum time needed to be able to apply rouding on that digit

```
	1. if digit < 4, time(i) = INF	

	2. if digit = 4, time(i) = time(i+1) + 1 

	3. if digit > 4, time(i) = 1;

```

We scan from left to the right to find the first time(i) <= t, and then we add 1 to the prefix 1...i-1. Carrying implmentation is much easier this way
