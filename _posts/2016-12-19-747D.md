What I did wrong during the contest
-----------
```
	1. Forget the impossible / -1 case, but the fact that have that check for the turing postive tail into negative case suggests such inconsistency is checking of calls means problem.
	
	2. My approach to the problem is slightly different. Instead of focusing on the negative segaments, and dirve formula based on that, and I just assume gap + 1 as number of segments, but this formula is wrong when there is no segments at all!

```

	I realized that the special case of last element being negative or not, but instead of using the "last one positive" as base case, I used "last one negative", but this one does not affect the code complexity
