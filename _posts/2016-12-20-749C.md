What I did wrong during the contest
-----------
```
	1. I thought about simulation, but I was not able to prove it will terminate quickly given 200k input size

	2. I was not able to prove the optimal strategy is indeed optimal

```

Why simulation run time could work
----------
For each vote, the total # of voters is decreased by one. Moreover, if a person is denied,we will remove that person from the line anyway. This means we will iterate through denied person O(n) times, and undenied person O(n) times 


Why the official stragety is optimal
----------
For the first element, assuming R, obviously need to deny one D before the next R.

If R has D both before and after it. Denying the one after the D's result is not worse than denying the one before it. Because if not, then another R after that D will be denied for sure, whereas denying that D means the next R still has some chance to live
