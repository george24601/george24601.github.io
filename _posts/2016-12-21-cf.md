697C: Lorenzo Von Matterhorn (!!!)
-----------
since node id < 10^18, each path has at most 64 nodes on the path
i.e., there is at most 64 * 1000 entries we need to update
for each node, we just record its edge length

When operation is update
----------
start from the tail, update the edge cost one by one

When operation is query
---------
start with the bigger number, because child id > parent id, calculate the path all the way to the LCA. Do the same thing for the small number 

if small number is prefix of big number, return num1 - num2, otherwise num1 + num2

The bug I made in the code is that I used root instead of LCA! There were also function parameters where I used int instead of LL.

This problems shows again that in a tree, for the two nodes, the importance of LCA




723C: Polycarp at the Radio (!!!)
---------

Idea 1 (my approach)
------
Assume all bands are within the m, then just take the average, that will be the target number, then swap until all counts are either floor(average) or floor(average) + 1  

when some numbers are outside the 1..m range, we will replace them only if n - oor < average * m < n

Algorithm:
--------
```
	1. count number of appearance for each number, and target

	2. scan through the array, if the band is oor, replace it with the next avaialbe one. If the band is one of the bigger ones, replace it with one of the underbudget ones. Note that we reduce oversied item to target + 1 instead of target at this step 

	3. scan through the array again, if there is any uninserted left, reduce the target + 1 to target

```

The mistake I made during coding is that the 2 rounds checking condition is inconsistent. One checks if the queue is empty, the other checks if the number is OOR. We need to check both in both places!

Idea 2 (official)
--------
Notice that we just want to minimize the number of total operations, therefore, we can replace all overbudget ones first with under budget ones first, and then in a second loop, repalce out of the range ones. 

This works because total # of operations is determined the total count of budget deficits, and has nothing to do the the order or selection of which over budget band to reduce

The main benefit of this approach is that we don't have to worry about the nasty n+1 case, i.e., the final shape will have as many bands m with songs as possible, as a comparison, the shape of my solution is to have lowest highest count

723D: Lakes in Berland
--------
DFS to find all connected waters, also for each water, mark if it is a lake or not, add it to the set of ids

Finally, scan through all cells, and fill the cells with marked ids
