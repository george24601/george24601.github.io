732C: Sanatorium(!!!)
---------

Idea 1: Formula
----------
min number of missing meal means number of days stay = highest number of on the list

If all 3 numbers are same, no missing.

If only 1 number has highest value:

number of full days = highest number - 1, and then the other 2 meals have 3 * number of days

if two numbers has highest value, 3 possiblilies, 

```
	1. (b, d) = full days? not really! consider the zig zag pattern!
	2. (b, l) = full days, in the final answer, --dinner
	3. (l, d) = full days, in the final answer, breakfast--

```

Idea 2: brute force
----------
brute force the tuple of (arrival, departure)



732D: Exams
---------
Start from the tail, keep track of which exams we have to pass. 

If it is a new exam, add days to the budget

If it is idle or seen example, budget-- 

Then we bsearch on the position of tail



733C: Epidemic in Monstropolis(!!!)
----------
Obviously, before sum = after sum

so given the first item, we can calculate which items that final item is made of

if no such index exists, or if all items scanned are the same, it is not possible.
Otherwise, start with the first heaviest monster in the left, and then eat all the way to the left, and finally eat all the way to the right

repeat for each item segment


What is wrong with this algorithm?
-----------
```
	1. I got WAed because my first biggest monster approach does not work in the case of [2, 2,1 ] => 5.

	2. To fix it, we just need to find the first maxI that can move, and then be greedy and try to each as much as we can
	
	3. My checks of two arrays having the same sum is implicit. Therefore, it didn't catch the case where a's sum > b's sum

```



733D:  Kostya the Sculptor
-----------
For each stone, add each of its face to a pair map, with the height as value, so we have 3 * n entries

go through each entry, find the max 2 number of faces, add them up, and keep track of the winners of two stones. We compare by checking min(3 edges)


727C: Guess the Array 
----------
Consider n = 3 case, we can just a1 + a2, a2 + a3, and a3 + a1 to solve it. We can use it as the seed for the n > 3 case

```
1. a1 + a2, a2 + a3, a3 + a1, solve a1, a2, a3, as per n = 3 case

2. a1 + a4, a1 + a5....., all the way to a1 + an

```
