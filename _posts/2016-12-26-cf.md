724C:  Ray Tracing
-----------

Claim: the ray will always hit a corner

Proof: If not, then we will form a closed loop, however, since we start at a corner, such loop is impossible


Claim: the ray hits each point only once
Proof: If not, then we will have a case where it comes in the oppsoite direciton to where it is from. Since the whole sequence is reversible, this means it will come from a corner and to a corner 

Algorithm
---------
```
	1. For each 2 * n * m points, keep track of when it is first hit
	2. Simulate the process by calculating the next point to hit, and the hit time
	3. For each point, calculate from which x or y axis it is hit, take the earlier point, and add the distance to the answer

```


706D:  Vasiliy's Multiset
-----------

Maintain a set for inserted numbers and its count to handle type 1 and 2 request

For type 3 request
```
	1. Use set.lower_bound() to decide if there is entry for the best prefix + 1, with this we can know if it is possible to put 1 bit or 0 bit on that position 

	2. look at the requested number, and pick the opposite number

	3. start with 2^30, all the way to 2^0
	
```
