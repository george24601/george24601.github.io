Consider the number of spare balloons we can spare

while we can spare more, give more to the next rank, and then delete ones that can be floated, keep going until we have no more to spare, and keep track of the best rank in the mean time

Implmentation-wise, using a double pointer style for-loop is way easier to reason than a while loop, even though while loop seems more intuitive -  took me an hour to figure it out.

This is similar to the first version. However, this approach failed on test 10!!!

The key insight I was missing is that we should only try getting rid of the teams ahead of us. Otherwise, our final rank can not be improved regardless

Algorithm
----------

```
	1. Add all t > k to the priority queue

	2. while we can remove from the PQ, we remove, and update the current k count.

	3. Since now we reduced k count, we need to move pointer further to include more entries > current k

```
