Typical complete search problem with generate-filter pattern. Because we have 2 constraints (uniqueness and value upperbound), we can
generate to-be-filtered data set in 2 different ways. The basic idea is to generate according to one constraint, and then filter generated
with another.

```
  1. generate all permutations of 0-7 with next_permutation, and check it first dn + dm digits to make sure the number formed < n and m. In the end, divide by
(7-dn-dm)! to filter out duplications. You can also use a set to maintain it, but it is more cumbersome to code

  2. generate all possible (n, m) pairs, and check this pair has no duplicate. I find this is easiler to code.
```
