Option 1:
---------
len(i, lastChange, hasChange): longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at i 

when we move to i + 1

len(i+1, false, false) = a[i+1] > a[i] ? len(i, false, false) : 0 + 1
len(i+1, true, true) = len(i, false, false) + 1
len(i+1, true, false) =  invalid case
len(i+1, false, true) = max of (
a[i+1] > a[i] ? len (i, false, true) : 0 + 1
a[i+1] > a[i-1] + 1? len(i, true, true)  : 1 + 1
)

and then check all (i, bool, bool) combos for max answer
base case= len(0, false,false) = 1, len(0, true, true) = 1


Option 2:
-------
Calculate all lenEnd(i),
Calculate all lenStart(i)

for all i, compute lenEnd(i) + lenStart(i), and get max

Techinique: 
Find all potential solutions and get the max value. This means looking at the unknown and try to infer from its properties,i.e., one out of
order means we need to search based on which entry is out of order
