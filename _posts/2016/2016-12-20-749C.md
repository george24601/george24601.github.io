What I did wrong during the contest
-----------
```
	1. I thought about simulation, but I was not able to prove it will terminate quickly given 200k input size

	2. I was not able to prove the optimal strategy is indeed optimal

```

Why simulation run time could work
----------
For each vote, the total # of voters is decreased by one. Moreover, if a person is denied,we will remove that person from the line anyway. This means we will iterate through denied person O(n) times, and undenied person O(n) times 


Why the official stragety is optimal
----------
For the first element, assuming R, obviously need to deny one D before the next R.

Now suppose we have RDRDR as we go, with the first D ready to vote,

```
1.If veto the first R, then any D can be vetoed by the next R. Similar argument goes for vetoing the third R

2.If veto the second R, then any D has a chance to not get vetoed, because later D MAY deny further Rs

3. If there is no D after the first D, then it doesn't matter which way we choose, i.e., as long as we pick a strategy and we know it is optimal for this case

```
