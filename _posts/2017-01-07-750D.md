Why I was stuck during the contest
------------
```
	1. I realize that the input size is small enough that I can keep states to avoid recomputing, but my upperbound is too much, in fact, each direction needs only 150 cells, but my bound is too loose at 300. Therefore, I spent much time reasoning about memory usage 

	2. I failed to realize that since the depth is only 5, I can just keep the explicit state on the current depth. The overall run time and memory usage will be increased by 5 times but are still within the bound

	3. I was not sure about how to implement the starting point in the middle of the map. Should it be at (160, 160) or (0, 0) ? In retrospect this doesn't matter much.


The overall memory = 320 * 320 * 4 * 5  < 25 mil, each cell in memory is filled once only => the running time is same



722D: Generating Sets
------------

Since we care about the max number, we can bsearch on that number, and reduce it to the prefix to fall under that, if there is no space, they we know the lowerbound is too low.

Note that my first idea is to be purely greedy: highest number try reducing to the lowest number, but I had difficulty proving it, and it actually failed one of the test cases
