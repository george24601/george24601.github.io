Why I was stuck during the contest
------------
```
	1. I realize that the input size is small enough that I can keep states to avoid recomputing, but my upperbound is too much, in fact, each direction needs only 150 cells, but my bound is too loose at 300. Therefore, I spent much time reasoning about memory usage 

	2. I failed to realize that since the depth is only 5, I can just keep the explicit state on the current depth. The overall run time and memory usage will be increased by 5 times but are still within the bound

	3. I was not sure about how to implement the starting point in the middle of the map. Should it be at (160, 160) or (0, 0) ? In retrospect this doesn't matter much.


The overall memory = 320 * 320 * 4 * 5  < 25 mil, each cell in memory is filled once only => the running time is same
