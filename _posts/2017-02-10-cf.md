749D: Leaving Auction
-------------
the last one always wins, so we just start from the bottom and find the first coming one. Note that we need to keep going for the equal case



707D: Persistent Bookcase (!!!)
-------------
If only operation 1,2, and 3, we can keep track of the inverse, and twist the operation as we go. This also means we need to maintain the
whole state. 

I was having problem handling the 4th operation, because I wasn't sure how to handle the memory and run time requirement when it comes to
revert. Turns out because we have all entries there already, we can do a full pre-computation and store the result, to avoid the case of
re-computing a single node many times => i.e., we cache it as part of computation progress!



711D: Directed Roads(!!!)
--------------
In a sunny graph, find the edges in the center circle. The final
answer will be (2^|size of cycle| - 2) * (2^|edges outside the cycle|) 

I had some problem calculating the size of cycle cleanly. Also, the graph may have multiple components.
