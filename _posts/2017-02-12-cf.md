721D: Maxim and Array
------------
we should try to make the product negative maximum. 

```
1. If the product is already negative, sort numbers by absolute value, keep increasing abs value until it is greater than the next one, keep
   going until we used all  k operations

2. if it is positive, find the min absolute value one, and try flipping the its sign

3. If impossible to make it negative, do something similar except with flipped signs

4. Of course, need to make all 0s x or -x first

```

724D: Dense Subsequence(!!!)
------------

Insights
--------
```
1. If the final answer has more than letter a, we should list ALL a in the string
2. If the final answer has only a, we should list a few as as possible. Morever, each a should not be separate by more than m. If not, we
   know that the answer must exist some letter other than 1, then by 1 we have to take all as
3. Therefore, the only letter that we don't take all is the last one, all we need to do is the find the biggest letter in the answer, and
  keep track of that count.

```


743D: Chloe and pleasant prizes
--------------
From the root, we have a few options,  

```
1. take the root, and the whole subtree 

2. don't take the root, and take the best subtree from it 

3. don't take the root, and take the best two subtree from it

```

So the state we keep

```
best2(node) = best choice of having 2 cuts from tree rooted at node 

best(node) = best choice of having only 1 cut from the tree rooted at node

```

Note implementation wise, we need 3 DP, best2, best , and rootSum


742D: Arpa's weak amphitheater and Mehrdad's valuable Hoses
-------------
Union-Find to group Hoses into groups, the state we keep is best[gn][w] = best score we can get with group 0...gn, with total weight w;

options we have
```
1. pick the whole group

2. pick anyone from the group. note that for each w, we go through all n only once, so the overall time is still O(n^2)

3. ignore the group

```

Note implementaion wise, it is similar to a knapsack problem, i.e., bottom-up with exactly same recurrsion as top-down. However, we do not
trigger the DP step until we know Find(i) = i. Otherwise, we just let best[i][w] = best[i-1][w], i.e., no op on this step

738C:  Road to Cinema 
------------
bsearch on the min fuel capacity, and try to spend all gas before the next station

738D: Sea Battle
----------
scan from left to right, find the first cell that the subarray 1..l can hold k ships, must hit that cell, after that , every time we have
enough to hold a ship, we need to hit it once.
