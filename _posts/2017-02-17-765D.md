If h and g exist, what properties can we infer?!!! 

f(f(x)) = h(g(h(g(x)))) = f(x)

i.e., for all values of f(x), it must be a stable point, i.e., f(vfx) = vfx

Now we just need to construct a solution to prove that as long as f(vfx) = vfx for all vfx presented, we can find g, and h

obviously, m <= distinct values of vfx, so we define g(vfx) = index(vfx), and h(index(vfx)) = vfx at that index

g(h(index(vfx))) = g(vfx) = index(vfx), i.e. g(h(mx)) = mx

h(g(vfx)) = h(index(vfx)) = vfx = f(vfx), i.e., h(g(nx)) = f(nx)

For numbers in [1,n] but not in vfx, just set g, h to be identity
