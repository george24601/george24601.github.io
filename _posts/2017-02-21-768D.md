Consider p=1000, q =1000, this is the max number of days we possible need to calculate

Pr(day, collected) =  Pr(on day -1, pick within collection)  *  Pr(day - 1, collected) + Pr(outside collection) * Pr(On day -1, pick outside collected - 1, collected - 1)

When p, q = 1000,  we can calucate to know day < 1000 for sure.

Therefore, we just calculate all probablilites with DP, for each queries, we can just do a linear search on Pr(day, k)
