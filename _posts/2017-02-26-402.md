Another round at 5am....

779A: Pupils Redistribution
-----------
I failed this A problem!!! To calcualte the final answer, i focused on the case where a[digit] - b[digit] > 0. However, I didn't consider the case when a[digit] < b[digit] , and the delta is odd. This means an exchange can never happen!

For B, spend 10 mins on the index/length of the proper prefix/suffix length, should have realized that when i set start = n-1, it is the last index of the prefix:w

C is at least k. At first I coded the case = k, wasted time on changing that.

I wasted too much time on D. I should have realized that when it is hard to get insight to solve it in a closed form, probably should try do searching + simulation, i.e., find a small search space or binary search
