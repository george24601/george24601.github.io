Idea
------------
Suppose k = 1, what the answer woule be?

```
For each edges, it will be the combination of the vs on the two sides, i.e., suppose the edge connects to (u, v), with v as the root of the subtree, the contribution of that edge will be S(v) * n - S(v), and the final answer is the sum of contribution over all edges
```
Insight: we have a closed form for this answer, and yet, it can be expressed as sum(L /1), where L is the length of a single path 

When k > 1, we know the final answer should be around sum(L/k), to be more specific, it will be sum(ceil(L/k))

Now we can separate the final answer into 2 parts

```
1. sum(L/k) = sum(L/1) / k = (answer in k = 1 case ) / k

2. sum(f(L, k)), where f(L, k) = k - (L % k), or 0 if L % k = 0 over all L

```

Now the problem becomes calculating the second part. The key is to swap sum over order, i.e., instead of caculating over all L, we can calculate over all k!!! 

That is, for each remainder, how many paths we have with L s.t. L % k = remainder, for each remainder, we need to add remainder * numer to the second part


Implementation
---------------
```
1. Inside DFS, we need to calculate both the subtree size and number of paths that starts at the root and with it length remainder k, i.e., depth % k = i

2. for each child of a, b, we need to add to the answer, given i, j, we can calculate the new path length as i + j - 2 * depth, note all calculations are within the mod k space. Total number of pathes is count[a][j] * cout[b][j], with remainging i + j - 2 * depth %k; !!!

3. after updateing the answer, we need to incluoud count[b][i] into count[a][i]

4. Don't forget add size(a) * (n - size(a)) to the answer
```
