A: Alphabet Cake
----------------

The key mistake I made during contest is that I didn't notice the condition "no initial appears more than once on the cake."!!!! 
Idea 1: Recursion
----------
```
1. If there is only 1 letter, we can fill the whole square with that letter

2. If there is more than 1 letter, we can make a cut repeatedly until we reach that base case, but how to make a cut?
```


Idea 2: Greedy
-----------
```
1. for each row, expand to all existing letters to its right

2. for each row, expand to all existing letters to its left

3. the remaining rows must be completely emtpy, we just run two copy passes to ensure they are copied
```

B: Ratatouille
-----------
The intuition is easy, but how to prove it?!!!
