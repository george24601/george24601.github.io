What I did right
--------------
```
1. I recognize that to advance to round 2, I have to solve B-large

2. When seeing a cycle, I realize that I should add the first item in the list to the end of list again, so that all segments are covered

3. I see the greedy insights 

```


What I did wrong
-------------
I was not able to prove the greedy insights!!! 


Proof
----------------
There are 3 types of intervals, a C-J interval, a J-J interval, and C-C interval. Note that our target function is the sum of switches introduced in each intervals.

Obviously, for each C-J interval, we increase the final answer by one 

For each J-J interval, we don't have to increase final answer at all,if we can plug in the gap with the same interval when we have enough J time left. Otherwise, we will have to increase the number of swtiches by 2.

Similar argument applies to C-C interval. Also, since we have complete assignment of minus, the leftover minutes will be shared among types of problems without interfering the validition of the solution, i.e., we don't have to worry about the case of they don't reach the minimal at the same time.

Therefore, our greedy solution can give the best value in each category at the SAME time (This is what I couldn't convince myself!!!) => our overall solution is optimal.
