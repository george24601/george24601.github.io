Consider the highest value and lowest value in all balls, obvioiusly they must be selected.

If both are Rs, then we have a candidate for Bmax and Bmin too, we can bsearch on the value of Bmax in the range of [Bmax, highest number in the unselected bad], becasue Bmax the smaller, the better.

```
1. Now we go through other bags, if both balls are outside range of R, bad

2. if one ball is outside range of R, update Bmax and Bmin for that B

3. if both are within the range of R, we pick the higher one < Bmin as the choice. If both balls > Bmax, we know it is bad

```

If highest is RMax and lowest is Bmin, we can bsearch on RMin, the idea is similar 


The end result is the smaller of the two
