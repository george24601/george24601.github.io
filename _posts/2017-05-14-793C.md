What I did wrong
-----------------
1. since the given precision is 1e-6, the epsilon should be 1e-12, because of the base offraction arithmetic is (1e-6)^2

2. To calculate the range of valid time, i calculate the segment as a whole, instead of separating them into two dimesnions. This introduced additional float point calculation and introduced errors!!!

Idea
----------
```
1. Mouses in ranges <=> each mouse is in range

2. Mouse in range <=> x is in x-axis range and y is in y-axis range. So we just need to search for a time range that satifies such condition.

3. Therefore, we just calculate the range it takes to stay in x-axis range and y-axis range, respectively, if there exists a common intersection, we know it is the answer, otherwise, it is impossible
```
