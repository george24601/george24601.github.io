Why I didn't solve it
--------------
I realizee that I can use bsearch and detect the direction of points by asking (i, i+1). However, I got stuck at handling the answer to my 
query => i.e., what does the answer mean?

Insights
---------
1. (mid, mid+1) returns true => there must exist one point to the left of mid, including mid

2. returns false => there must exist one point to the right of mid+1, include mid + 1

3. So we can just do a bsearch, and we know there must exist an point in our range, and we can definitely find one => when r - l = 1

4. Now that we repeat similar bsearch in [1, mid) and (mid + 1, n], we know that at least one points in the intervals for sure
