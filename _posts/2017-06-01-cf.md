333B: Chips
----------
1. Because of rule 2 and 3, we can not add chips to both ends 

2. Because of rule 2, given i, we can add to either row i or col i, but not both

3. So we just start from 1 to n-2, try adding either to row and col


115B: Lawnmower
----------
1. Note that we have to mow them row by row

2. At the last position of that row, if we are to the left of the left most 
```
if we are facing right, we go to the right most row, go down, and mow from right to left
if we are facing left, go down, and mow to the right
```
3. If we are to the right of the right most, similar but with mirrored steps

4. If we are between leftmost and right most, we will move to the closer one , move down, and then move to the other direction

5. If there is even empty rows between the next row and previous filled row, nothing happens

6. If there is odd empty rows, we need to try moving additional cols to align with leftmost or right most

Therefore, at each row, we need to consider 4 cases
```
Last leftmost => cur leftmost
last leftmost => cur rightmost
last rightmost => cur rightmost
last rightmost => cur leftmost
```
and keep track of cost at cur left most and cur right most

The final result the min of the two


34D: Road Map
----------
The old map represents a parent-child relationship easily. Therefore, we can construct the graph and do a simple tree traversal to update the new map


367B:  Sereja ans Anagrams
-------------
Notice that p is fixed. We can just group entries by ps, and then do a slide window scan to match all possible starting indices


776D:  The Door Problem
----------
Suppose there exists a solution, what property it has?

1. If the door is closed : then t(d1) + t(d2) is even, i.e., they have the same oddity

2. If the door is open: then t(d1) + t(d2) is odd, they have the same oddity

Note that each switch has only 2 choices, even or odd, any numbers can be reduced to this choice.

Conversely, if we can find an arrangement that satifies such odditiy requirment, then we know in the end all doors are open => i.e., we are good, and this condition is strong enough.

So what we can do
1. In case 1, we union them
2. For case 2, we union all it opponents
3. In the end, we scan through all contradictions again, to make sure they are not unioned, i.e., no conflict
