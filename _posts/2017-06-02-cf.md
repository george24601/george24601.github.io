319B: Psychos in a Line
------------
We keep track of: cur left most value, current timer, and latest timer

while the sequence is decreasing, the timer = curTimer + 1 

if the next value is > current value but < leftMost value, repeat the same process
currentTimer ++

if the next vlaue > leftmost value, reset the current timer to 0, and update the latest timer

My idea
----------
Assume they are all distinct
Suppose we have one such collection, it must be of V shape in terms of values

So we start with each local minimal points, and try expanding, because of that v shape-thing, we know we cover each point at most once
So we try calculating longest right-expanding sequence, and then reverse and calculate the longest left-expanding sequence, and then sum it up

Note the corner case where all values are same, we will have multiple entries

Official solution
---------
Binarly search on the value of r-l, use a data structure to answer GCD(l,r) and min(l, r),e.g., a segment tree-ish DS
