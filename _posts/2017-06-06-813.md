813B: The Golden Age
----------
Need to take care of long long overflow. I use a log based solution to limit the max value for a and b. The official solution uses 

```
while x <= L/ a
	x *= a;
```

and calculate the powers inside iteration


813D: Two Melodies(!!!)
----------
Since we care only the last entry, we will keep track of dp[x][y] => last index of the each list

Obviously, we can enforce x > y due to symmetric rule, 

then we start y from 0 to n, and then scan x from y + 1 to n
need to know max of dp[k][y] s.t. a[i] % 7 = a[k] % 7
need to know max of dp[k][y] s.t. a[i] - 1 = a[k]

so 4 cases to consider when we update dp[i][y]
