703D: Mishka and Interesting sum (!!!)
-----------

Insights
---------
```
1. answer to query = XOR of all elements XOR distinct elements

2. To answer XOR of distinct elements => we need to solve "find # of distinct values in a segment", need to help of Fenwicks Tree

3. Need to process queries in sorted by ending index way, so that we update each entry in the segment tree only once

4. Final runtime is O(nlogn)

```
