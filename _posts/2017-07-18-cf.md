828C: String Reconstruction
---------
A brute force way will timeout. What can we do to remove duplicate operations?

So we need to track of continuous intervals, and skip them if it is already filled.

We can use a union-find ds, with an additional DS to keep track of next start index. 


Pseudocode
-------
```
void tryFill(i, k) {
	start = x[i][k]

	while(start < t[i].length){
		parent = find(start)

		if (s[start] == '?') {
			s[i] = t[start]
			
			if (start > 0 s[start -1] != '?'){
			Union(start, start -1)
			} 
				
			if (start < t[i].length - 1 && s[start + 1] != '?'){
			Union(start, start +1)
			} 

			
		} 

		nextStart = right[parent]
	}
}

```





831C: Jury Marks
-------
Calculate prefix sum of scores, and sort both deltas. We know the min value of B must match [0, k - n] of the delta array, so we can just brute froce on each potential match to see if it is feasible to backtrack, calculate the backtrack and add the calculated result to the result set

Note that once we fix ONE mapping between b(i) and a(j), the whole sequence becomes deterministic, i.e., the answer <= k - n + 1
