Round 55: Build the Fence
------------
Note that we can repeat the cut, i.e., 7 can turn into 3, 3, 1 => Therefore, higher k, less likely to achieve => bsearch on K

Round 55: Matrix Palindromes
----------
Suppose K = M, then we can calculate the total cost to make the whole matrix palindrone.

1. If all 4 letters are the same => cost 0
2. If distribution is 3-1 => cost 1
3. If distribution is 2-2 or 2-1-1 => cost 2
4. Otherwise, cost is 3;

For each column, compare it the the case where, only rows are palindromes and columns are not. Then we pick the best M - K cost saved

Round 53: Histogram Partition
-----------
Lets look for a O(n^2) solution first!!! 
For each integer, we need to add 1 to cost, if there does not exist int = current int before running into anything shorter.
note that we are just interested in the number <= current one, so all numbers > current one can be ignored
So we can maintain a stack, so that each item is checked only once, and end result is an increasing number on stack


Round 53: Parallel Rectangles
----------
We can brute force in two ways
1. check out all (LL, UR) pairs, this works well if not many distinct xs
2. for each pair of (x, y1), (x, y2), store the frequence of (y1, y2). This works well if not too few distinct xs 

The key insight is to combine them togehter!!!

So we check each x-axis. If # of ys > S, use first approach, otherwise, use second approach. To choose S, consider that the second appraoch, cost is around N * S/2 * log(N), so S should be < around 50, to limit total steps around 10^6. The first appraoch will run at most N/S times, each takes N, i.e., this means S should be larger than root(N)


Round 48: 8 Divisible
----------
To be able to divisible by 8, we can break the number = a number < 200 but division by 8 + a number divisible by 200 => this just suggests that the last 3 digits divisible by 8 <=> whole number divisible by 8!!!

Then we can generate string, and keep the lexically smallest, excluding ones with leading 0s => 10^3 choices * 10^3 length each


Round 48: Dominant Free Sets
------------
O(n^2) gives obvious DP relationship. Use Fenwick tree to speed up!!!
