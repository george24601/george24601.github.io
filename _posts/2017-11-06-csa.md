Round 46: Set Subtraction	
---------
Take the min number, and try all 1k possible X
sort the numbers, scan from left to right, if num(a[i] ) > num(a[i] + X), bad, otherwise, reduce both a[i] and a[i] + X
Note: we can use two pointer techinque here instead of sets, because the first pointer should never catch up with second one because x is positive !!!


Round 45: Remove Update
---------
Use sweep line to calcuate the final results after all updates. and then calculate maxStart[i]= max value in 1...i, maxEnd[i] = max value in i....n

For each segment, the answer is max(maxSeg - segV, maxStart[i], maxEnd[i]), and we take the minimum. 

Note that we can use the partial sum trick to simulate operations!!!
1. calculate s[i] = a[1] +.....a[i]
2. p[l] = v, p[r] = -v

Also, note that to minize max value, we need to consider intervals that contains all maximal values after applying all entries, which is also the max value we are looking for!!!
Becaues if the interval does not cover all max As, then the remining max A entry will remain the new max value after removal. Even better, in implementation,we can just assume max value is such for ANY interval anyway, because those do not satify this will not affect our final results - maxStart and maxEnd will cover that!

Round 44: Check DFS
----------
we start with the node, at every step. if p(i) and current stack top is an edge, we add it the stackkeep going. Otherwise,  we pop the stack until we have it!, and then add to the stack

terminating condition is we go through all perms

Official solution!!!
If node v is visited before node u, then we know v can not appear after u in adjacency list. Therefore, we sort adjacnent list by the order in permutation, and then do a native DFS and compare orders


Round 44: Count Squares
---------
consider each square parallel to axis, if the length is n, then we can form n squares within the square, each side with manhanttan distance n. Therefore, the answer is

```
1 * (x-1) (y - 1) + 2 * (x-2) (y-2) + .....+ 1 (x-n-1) (y- n - 1)
```
i.e., the bouding box of a square is also a square
