Round 46: Set Subtraction	
---------
Take the min number, and try all 1k possible X
sort the numbers, scan from left to right, if num(a[i] ) > num(a[i] + X), bad, otherwise, reduce both a[i] and a[i] + X


Round 46: Count Gigel Matrices
---------
we need 3 prefix sums, one horizontal, one vertical, one diagonal, and then we can brute force all n^2 combinations
When caclculating diagonal prefix sumes, need to iterate over both row and cols to form the complete triangle


Round 45: Remove Update
---------
Use sweep line to calcuate the final results after all updates. and then calculate maxStart[i]= max value in 1...i, maxEnd[i] = max value in i....n

For each segment, the answer is max(maxSeg - segV, maxStart[i], maxEnd[i]), and we take the minimum


Round 44: Check DFS
----------
we start with the node, at every step. if p(i) and current stack top is an edge, we add it the stackkeep going. Otherwise,  we pop the stack until we have it!, and then add to the stack

terminating condition is we go through all perms


Round 44: Count Squares
---------
consider each square parallel to axis, if the length is n, then we can form n squares within the square, each side with manhanttan distance n. Therefore, the answer is

```
1 * (x-1) (y - 1) + 2 * (x-2) (y-2) + .....+ 1 (x-n-1) (y- n - 1)
```
