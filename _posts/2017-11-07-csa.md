Round 42: Prefix Matches
---------
for each A[i], we know that B[i + A[i]] = max(A[j] , j + A[j] = i + A[i]), so we can through and upgrade it, then from n to 1, we maintain current length l, and B[i] = l, l--, or update l to the new B[i] if B[i] > l


Round 42: Sorting Steps
--------- 
Runtime Analysis is similar to a potential method. We defind cost(i) = number of entiers > a[i] to the left i.  For each operation, cost[i] -- for all cost[i] > 0, otherwise it means some bigger number is blocked. We continue this process until all cost(i) = 0. Therefore, overall # of steps = max(cost[i])

How to calculate max(cost[i]) without a complex data structure?!!!

Observations:
1. If an entry has max(cost[i]), i must not have j > i and a[j] < a[i]. Otherwise, cost[j] > cost[i]
2. Since all numbers < a[i] are to the left of i, cost[i] = i - real position 



Round 56: Find Edge List
---------
DAG Topological sort with cycle detection. I solved it slower than I expected.

1. For cycle detection, maintain visited, visiting, unvisited state. Note for undirected graph, we just need 2 stages, and will find it the moment we reach a visited stage

2. The inverse of the topological sort does not mean print before the depth. The counter exampe is A -> B <- C, the inverse of the topological sort should be A -> C -> B, but print it before going depth, we will hit, A-> B -> C

3. Either add a fake node with edges to all nodes, or find a node with no incoming edges. Need to handle the case of every node has incoming edge -> a cycle already


Round 56: Find Path Union
---------
Given the max #, we can know the max value of the tree, and the max level of the node, then we iterate from the max to min value => if current node's left or right child is not in the set, then we add max level - depth(node) to the sum. Final answer the total # of full tree - sum
