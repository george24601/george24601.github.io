Round 54: Pair Swap
-------------
Maintain a heap of next k entries, we will swap with current head and break if 

1. heap top < current head

2. heap top is maximal in the heap, but within the range 

The moment we find it we can stop

Note: official solution uses a dequeue!!!
1. maintain a dequeue s.t. elements forms an increasing sequence, i.e., i < j and a[i] < a[j], with the last entry being a[i + k]
2. every time we seen a new entry, we add a[i+k] to the tail of the queue, after we pop the tail to remove bad ones
3. becaues we moved i to the left, and i < j and a[i] < a[j], the head of the queue may be i itself (valid in the last iteration but not this one anymore) => so we need to pop it


Round 54: Spanning Trees
------------
We can construct tree in two parts: 1. share nothing, 2. share everything => i.e., if we have solution for (N,K), we also have a solution for (N+1, K+1) => we just add an external node

share nothing works when N >= 4, when N = 1 , 2, or 3, we can just brute force


Round 52: Virus on a Tree
---------
calcuate subtree size, sort by size, for each cut one, traverse to mark as cut already

Note in implementaion, we can pass a canSave flag, and save only the root of possible tree to cut, and add the root/size to a list

Round 52: Game on a Circle
--------
check 1, 12, 23,..., 89 until we find the first black. if no black so far, then we know b = 9, 9 and 19 would be black 

upon finding a black c[i], 
```
when i is not the first entry we tried
we check c[i - 1]. 
	if c[i - 1] is white, we check c[i+ 1] 
		if  c[i + 1] is black, we know value of a, we also know that a[i + 10] can not be black, so does a[i + 20....]
		if c[i + 1] is white, then we know the value of b, and you know c[i - 9]....c[i - 1] can not be black, because a >= i - 9 or  < i - 10 - 10  
	if c[i-1] is black, if know c[i - 11] is white, we can try all other 9 * c[i - 11 + n * 10].
		
when i is the the first entry we tried
	keep going until we reach the second black si, then we can try si + 10....skip mod = i...skip mod = si
```

Official solution
-----------
1. imagine the game as a 10 * 10 grid!!!
1. ask 0, 11, 22,....99, until we have two blacks
2. if we have 2 blacks, we know those two columns might be back, so we just try the other 9 columns
3. If we have only 1 black, we know that column might be black, so we just try all remaining columns

Round 51: Manhattan Distances
---------
Manhattan distance is similar to the idea of linear two, a + b >=  c, and then we can fix (0, 0) and (0, c), and make the third point (x, y) s.t. 

1. x + y = a

2. b - x + y = c

Note that if a soution exists, the a+ b+ c is even, because consider x1 < x2 < x3, the total value is 2 * (x3 - x1) + 2 * (y3 - y1) (Note, xi and yi may not belong to the same point!)
