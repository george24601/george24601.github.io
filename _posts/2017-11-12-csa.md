Round 51: Tree Coloring
---------
Root level: (k chooses 1 +  # neighbor)
Other non-leaves level: (k - 2 chooses # neighbors)
leaf level : 1

The answer is the product of all. Note need to calcualte N choose k in linear time

Round 49: Max Substring
--------
count # of appearance for each char. For each char in a-z,
we increase the length of guesses 1 by 1, until we hit prev same char or reachs index -1, or the position at that char is different


Round 49: Amusement Park 
-------
DP on the expected value, Ex(t, a). 
Note the boundary coniditon => Ex(0, x) = 0

```
Ex(t, a) = 1 + Pr(t, a) * (Ex(t, a + 1)) + (1 -Pr(t, a)) * Ex(t -1, a +1)
```

Round 47: Gcd Rebuild
--------
Init base U, V factors to 1
For each V, just calculate the LCM of the i-row. 
For each U, just calculate the LCM of the i-column.

Note that we act greedily here, if other numbers are possibles, they must be a multiple of LCM anyway. So we just try LCM to reduce the likelyhood of OOB

And then run through the UV matrix again to verify


Round 47: Expected Merge
---------
DP on Ex(l), use a vector to store the length, since each will be visited only once. The overall cost will be same as merge sort

Consider calc(l)
```
for i in  0 to l
ans[i] += l

calc(l/2)

if(l is even){

for (j, 0, l/2)
	ans[j] += Ex(j, l/2)

for(j, 0, l/2)
	ans[l/2 + j] += Ex(j, l/2)
}else if(l is odd){

calc(l/2 + 1)

for (j, 0, l/2)
	ans[j] += 1/2(Ex(j, l/2) + Ex(j, l/2 + 1)

//middle one is special
ans[l/2]  = 1/2(Ex(l/2 - 1, l/2) + Ex(0, l/2 + 1))

for(j, 0, l/2){
	ans[l/2  + 1 + j] += 1/2(Ex(j, l/2) + Ex(j + 1, l/2 + 1)) 
}

```
