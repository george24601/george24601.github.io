Round 43: Bad Triplet
----------
if all deg <=2, then we must find a cycle with length % 3 = 0 

if exists V deg >= 3, then either we find a cycle with length 3, or the V and neighbor itself is good enough!!!i.e., all passes through the central V.


Round 41: Tennis Tournament
---------
if player wins M matches, then the first 2^M -1, must be worse then him, and 2^M + 1.. 2^(M+1), must have at least one that is better than him

Round 41: BFS-DFS
---------
We need to satisfy both BFS and DFS. So to satify DFS, a trivial answer will be D1 -> D2-> D3 -> D4...
To satify BFS, a trivail answer will be B1 -> B2, B1 -> B3.... 
Turns out these 2 can be satified AT THE SAME TIME!!! if we just add edges together!

The invalid case will be the that B1 -> B2 is different from D1 -> D2


Round 40: Switch the Lights
----------
We need to toggle the first one, and keep a switched bool for each i

for each i, if i dark, continue. Otherwise, switch the current swtich flag, and add one at bool[R(i)], and then add apply the exsting switch flag. Alternatively, we can use a counter


Round 40: Restricted Permutations
---------
ways(1, 1) = 1
calculate totalWays(N-1, i)
ways(N, i) = totalWays(N-1, i - 1) if a[N - 1] = 1
Otherwise, ways(N, i) = ways(N-1, i) + ways(N-1, i + 1)...ways(N-1, N -1) = (N-1)! - totalWays(N-1, i - 1)
Instead of inverse, we can just calculate partialSum(i, j)!!!
