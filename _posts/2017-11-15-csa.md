Round 39: Reconstruct Sum
--------
ways(0, true) = 0
ways(0, false) = 1
ways(i, true) = 

if (a[i] = 0)
	# of ways to form 9 * ways(i - 1, true)
else
	# of ways to form a[i] - 1 * ways(i-1, false) + # of ways to form (a[i] + 9) * ways(i-1, true) 

ways(i, false) = 
	# of ways to form (a[i] + 10) * ways(i-1, true) + # of ways to form (a[i]) * ways(i-1, false)



Round 39: Seven-segment Display
--------
Note the cost we have:2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6,4,8,5,6
To be smallest, the first digit either it is a 0 or never happens
i.e.,
possible(0, K) = possible(0, K - 6) or possbile(1, K)

of course, we need to keep track of nextDigit(0, k) here



Round 38: Bounded Difference
--------
1. find the total # of violations
2. swap a[i - 1] with a[0], a[1]...., and calculate # of violations afterwards
3. swap a[i] with with a[0],a[1]...., and calcualte # of viodlations afterwards

We break only if total # of violations is reduced to 0 in any cases

Round 38: Tree Antichain (Easy)
--------
