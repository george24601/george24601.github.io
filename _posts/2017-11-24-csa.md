Round 29: Equality
----------
Note that after each operation, the total sum does not change. Thus, in the extreme case all will be floor(sum/N) or floor(sum/N) + 1. Therefore, the upper cut offline must be in (floor(sum/N) + 1, curMax). 

Moreover, we notice that in this range, there exists a highest possbile upper cutoff line, so we can bsearch on the upper cut off line

Round 29: Odd Palindromes
-----------

Round 28: Card Shuffle
--------
for each index -i, calculate cycle length. each card appear only once in the cycle  - so linear

Note that the cycle can't have the leading trail problem, because otherwise, the existing one will run into a collsion with the starting one if we run it infinite numbers => i.e., start1 + x * c1 =start2 + x * c2 always exist a solution

Round 28: Water Bottles
--------
Idea 1: 
1. consider the final arragment, we bsearch on the maximum value. The max value range is  min(minValue + residue, maxV) over all is. Min value is the min of max value.

Idea 2: event based!!! 


Round 27: Huge Matrix
--------


Round 27: X Distance
--------

Round 26: Bounded Distinct
--------

Round 26: Build the Towers
--------

Round 25: Rectangle Path
--------

Round 25: min-ends-subsequence
--------
