1. vault goes to /usr/bin

2. vault config in /etc/vault.d/vault.hcl

```
backend "consul" {
  address = "127.0.0.1:8500"
  path    = "vault/"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_disable = 1
}
```

Note that the consul address is local, because it is talking to the local consul agent, as per recommendation of Hashicorp 

3. Systemd config in /etc/systemd/system/vault.service

```
[Unit]
Description=Vault
Requires=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vault server -config /etc/vault.d/vault.hcl
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
KillSignal=SIGTERM

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

4. Note that this template has no autoscaling group/launch configuration setup.

5. It also has config and setup for consul client. The configuration layout is exactly same as the consul quickstart
