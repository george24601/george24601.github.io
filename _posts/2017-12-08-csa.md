Round 60: Digit Permutation
-----------
Note that for topologic sort, after each dfs call, even if you start with a node without incoming edge, the component may not be traversed fully yet!!! A counter example is a -> b <- c. C is not touched after we did a -> b

This is not a problem will not occur if 
	1. the graph is a tree (only 1 node with incoming endge 0)
	
	2. undirected, flood fill problems

	3. a depends on b, i.e., b should be printed first

However, in this problme I chose a < b => a -> b, i.e., a should be printed first. This means I should reverse the orddr until the whole traverse is over!!!

To assign 0, we can just start with 1, and skip it when we reach the 0 node in the final list. Because the 0 node  has no incoming edge, it will not cause conflict.


Round 60: Card Groups
----------
Consider the case where two sides are equal,i.e., we need to solve equal-sum problem.

We just do a brute force bitmark caluclate, with a twist calculation the targetm function. Complexity 2^40 * 40


Round 10: Shifted Diagonal Sum
----------
Just calc all potential diagonals, 

Round 10: Subarray Medians
----------


Round 9: Flip Game
---------
Obviously, we need to change all in column 1 to 1. Two options, rows flips to 0, and then col flip, and then col flip

After that, we just do col flip as long as we get more 1s

Round 9: Array Removal
---------
Reverse the order of ops, and use a union find to keep track of the start of subarrays. and update the max sum as we move
