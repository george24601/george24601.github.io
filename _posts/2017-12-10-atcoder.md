agc001_b: Mysterious Light
----------
Base case x = y, ans = 3 * y

if x > y, ans  = x + y + x + ans (y- x, x) 

similar to x < y

agc001_c : Shorten Diameter
---------


arc058_b: Iroha and a Grid
----------
Note that H, W <= 100K.  

ways(1,1) -> (H, W) = ways(1,1) -> (i, B) *  ways(i, B) -> (H, W), for all i in [1...A)

First part is choose(i + B, i), second part is choose(H-i + W-B, H-i)

arc058_c: Iroha and Haiku
--------
ways(i, s) = ways to find XYZ in 1...i, ending at i, with s being the stage

ways(i, 0) = 1

ways(i, s) = sum over ways(j, s-1), j < i, and ps(j..i) = v[s] 

agc002_b: Box and Ball
--------
We need to maintain 
1. cnt for each box

2. at current step, possible for for it to have red ball

3. red ball poitions we have visited

for each move, we mark the next one as possible if cnt[i] > 0 && possible[i]. When cnt[i] = 0, possible[i] becomes false


agc002_c: Knot Puzzle
---------
Possible if L(first) + L(second) > L, just untied them from tail to head

arc059_b: Unbalanced
---------
just check substr of length 2 and 3

agc003_b: Simplified mahjong
---------
standard greedy approach, add a[i] to current, then current =% 2

agc003_c: BBuBBBlesort!
--------
1. check if the current index is odd or even

2. if the oddifity is different, +1, plus, flip the oddility of the number at current index

arc060_b: Digit Sum
--------
Higher b, f gives higher value, so we bsearch on b

arc060_c: Tak and Hotels
-------
Use two pointer to calc, next(i) = rightmost hotel the pointer can reach

agc004_b: Colorful Slimes 
--------


arc061_b: Snuke's Coloring
--------
brute force on all 3 * 3 * 10^5 UL corner of coordniation


arc061_c: Snuke's Subway Trip
--------
