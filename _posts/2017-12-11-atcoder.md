agc005_b: Minimum Sum
----------
maintain next[i], prev[i], the index of next and previous unseen index, at i 

We iterate value from n to 1, use the reverse index to update next and prev

agc005_c: Tree Restoring
---------
Given the input, we know the diameter of the tree.

Assumign D is even, we also know the min value must exactly D/2, and there is only one such point. so we just build the two legs of length D/2, each, and then, given each remaining d(i), directly attaches to a node with max distance d(i) - 1 


agc006_b: Median Pyramid Easy
---------
As we move each level up, the max value, and lowest value can not be preserved, so the final 1 + level <= value <= N - level

level = (N-1)/2 => (N+1)/2<= value <= (N+1)/2 => one and only solution

agc007_b: Construct Sequences
----------
A crazy construction!!!
a(i) = 30000 * i 
b(i) = 30000 * (n - i) + inverse(i)
