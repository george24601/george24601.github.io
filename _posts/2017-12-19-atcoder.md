arc065_b: Connectivity
----------
Do a flood fill on road to decide which city goes to which component, and then flood fill again on rail roads, but add the edge only if the two nodes are in the same components

agc008_b: Contiguous Repainting
--------
The final form must have a continons block of black or white of length >= K. 

So we just try all i, and candidates are positives in [0, i), [i+k, n], max(sum[i, i+k), 0))

agc008_c: Tetromino Tiling
-------
Note that only I, O, J, L matters. if I is odd, and give that extra to a J, L combo

agc010_b: Boxes
---------
We can caluate exactly how many ops we performed O. if a2 - a1 = O, we know that no ops NOT in a1. Conversely, suppose we have O1 opes on a1, then the a2 - a1 = -O1 * (n-1) + O - O1,i.e., we can infer how many ops are on a1 


agc010_c: Cleaning
---------
Try to let the subtree resolve themself, and return how many edges will come out of the subtree. if all outpaths = even and total pair <= root count, we are good

agc011_b: Colorful Creatures
--------
For each i, we need to calc 

1. minL(i) = minSize to merge all [0...i), 

2. minR(i) = minSize  to merge all (i,...n)

For each i, we try both left -> right, and right -> left, sequence of actions. Add that color to answer, if the sequence is possible. Note we need to change the creature size, after the first direction
