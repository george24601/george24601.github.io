arc070_b: No Need
----------
My idea: Start with biggest number, and scan from left, flush every time we are able to find seg sum >= K

Official solution 
---------

arc071_c: TrBBnsformBBtion
----------
Upon inspection, we can see that AA <-> B, and BB <-> A, so we can just covert all B to A, and see the diff in length % 3 = 0

agc013_b: Hamiltonish Path
---------
Use the "growth" approach!!!

We just start with an edge and changing the endpoint if one endpoint has a neighbor that is not in the path yet. Keep doing this, and we will exhaust all unchecked vetirces in N - 1 steps, or we reach an dead end.

arc074_b: 3N Numbers
-------
maintain a minheap and a max heap, and move separator i from N to 2N - 1

agc015_b: Evilator
-------
same direction one, opposite twice

agc015_c: Nuske vs Phantom Thnook
-------
For a forest, we know # of components = total # of nodes - total # of edges. Cutting the region will preserve the forest properties. Therefore, we just need to calculate how many nodes, and edges in that subregion, e.g., by 2-D prefix sum!!!

arc075_b: Widespread
--------
bsearch on the number of expositions, calculate # of As we need for each monster and see if the total sum is good

agc016_b: Colorful Hats
--------

Official solution goes by classfication!!!

1. max = min, then all unique or all the same

2. max = min + 1, we know that A = max(a(i)). So number of unique cats = cats with A - 1. A >= unique + 1 and A <= unique + freecat/2 


agc016_c: +/- Rectangle
-------
As long as H * W % h * w != 0. It is always possible. Set corner to 10^9, every other to the min v, s.t. v * (h * w - 1) > 10^9 
Official construction
--------
1. if the row number % h = 0, then write positve number. Otherwise, write negative number.

2. The ratio will be fixed at h/1, so one construction is to have 1000(h-1) - 1 as postive, and -1000 as negative!!!
