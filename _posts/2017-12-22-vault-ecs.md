1. Instead of a config file, can pass the json to VAULT_LOCAL_CONFIG env var

```json
{
  "backend": {
    "consul": {
      "address": "${LOCAL_IP}:9500",
      "advertise_addr": "http://${LOCAL_IP}",
      "path": "vault/"
    }
  },
  "listener": {
    "tcp": {
      "address": "0.0.0.0:8200",
      "tls_disable": 1
    }
  }
}
```
Note in the official docker script it expects the string in json instead of HCL

2. Vault client need a client token, which can be read from VAULT_TOKEN environment variable

3. After we unseal, we can auth with root token

```bash
vault auth $ROOT_TOKEN
```

We also need to create policy for the team to use.

4. Vault UI needs VAULT_URL_DEFAULT and VAULT_AUTH_DEFAULT. By default, the UI listens to 8000. Vault itself seems to need VAULT_ADDR?

5. In the official image, 3 directories are used:

	1. /vault/logs, also exposed as data volumes

	2. /vault/files, also exposed as data volumes. Potentially long running states there.

	3. /vault/config, NOT exposed as data volume

6. The official image does not init or unseal the vault - you have to do it yourself
