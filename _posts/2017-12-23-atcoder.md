arc076_b: Built?
--------
Sort by deltas in x or y coordinate, and then add edge iff it will the new edge will expand existing components => similar to MST

arc076_c: Connected?
--------

Hard problem to me!!!

Official solution
---------

1. Given two numbers, it is impossible to construct if all 4 occurance appear in the order of 1,2 ,1, 2 clockwise, i.e., we form a line that cuts the plane into halves. Note if only one number is on the boundary, we can force all lines to go along the sides

2. So we connect all non-boundary numbers first, and then all boundary numbers 

3. We can use a stack and go clockwise to make sure no intersecting boundary numbers

arc077_b: 11
-------
Classfication:
with both same numbers
with 0 same numbers
with 1 number, and nothing in between
with something in between, and one number either to the left or right

agc017_b: Moderate Differences
-------
Rearrange all the operations to do increase first, and then decrease second, do a brute force search on all possible turning points


arc078_b: Fennec VS. Snuke
-------
Find the path between two starting cells, and find the edge where the two colors. Calculate subtree size rooted at either end of the cell - the bigger one wins


agc018_b: Sports Festival
-------
Assume all sports are selected, and we calculate how many people are on each sports. Then we start taking out sports one by one, and update all affected users in the process in O(n)


arc079_b:Decrease (Contestant ver.)
--------
Reverse the operation, it is equivalent of removing K from each number, and then add N - 1 K times to a[i]s.

When K <= N, We can think the operation, as adding K to each number, and then remove N-1 K times. This means the intial array can not have more than  N - K values >= N - K. And the remaining K values in the intial array < N + K   

When K > N, we know that for sum of floor((a[i] + k) - (N -1)) = K, we can brute force on i to decide how many entries will have the max possible value, and how many will have only 0. Note there might be one a[i] with a value between 0 and max


arc079_c: Decrease (Judge ver.)
--------
Reverse the operation, it is equivalent of adding K to each number, and then remove N - 1 K times to a[i]s. So we can bsearch on the min K, s.t., after K removals, all will be less than N 


arc080_a: 4-adjacent
--------
1. each odd number must be followed by a product of 4

2. each product of 2, must be followed by a product of 2 or 4

So we use all 4s to try to satifiy the first condition, and then see if product of only 2 is odd, if so, it is impossible only if we have no 4 remaining

arc080_b: Grid Coloring
--------
Use the zig zag line construction for each square. Use a event-based two-pointer model when coding
