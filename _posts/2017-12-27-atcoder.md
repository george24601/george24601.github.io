arc070_b: No Need
----------

arc081_b: Coloring Dominoes
----------
Just do a linear scan from left to right. The number of ways is deterministic at each step, 3 cases, ||, |=, ==,

agc019_b: Reverse and Compare
---------
Consider the contribution from individual approach!!! 

If a[i] = a[j], doing a swap will not contribute to the final count, because it will be same as swapping i + 1, j - 1.

Conversely, if a[i] != a[j], it will definitely contribute to the final count. 

Proof: if swapping i and j  does not contribute to the unique count, then there must exist i1, j1, s.t., i1 =< i, and j1 >= j, s.t., swaping gives the same answer. But this implies i, j is on the same side of a palindrome, i.e., a[i1] = a[j1], this contradicts with fact that a[i1] = a[j1] does not contribute to the final count

Therefore, we can count char count for each letter, and the answer is N^2 - sum of ( count ) * (count -1)/2

arc082_b: Derangement
---------
Consider the first i = p[i], if p[i - 1] < i - 1, swap i and i - 1, otherwise, swap i and i + 1

arc083_b: Restoring Road Network
--------
Order shortest paths by length, and we try adding them as edge one by one. Every time we see a new shortest path, we try finding the current shortest path between the two end points, if it is longer than the current path, we know that this must be a new edge. add it to the network

agc010_c: Cleaning
---------

Official solution
---------


arc084_b: Small Multiple
---------
try all 1s from 1 to K 1s, by pigeon hole principle

1. At least 1 will have mod K  = 0

2. very likely to have two numbers with same mod. 

Whichever one comes first will give the answer


arc085_b: ABS
--------
