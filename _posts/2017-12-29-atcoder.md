arc081_c: Don't Be a Subsequence
--------
Start from empty string, try finding the first index where all a-z are included. If unable to find it before the end of the string, we have an answer. Otherwise, reset indices, and repeat the process 

arc081_d: Flip and Rectangles
--------
Consider the easier version: if there is no change, how do you find the black rectangle with the larget area?!!!

arc083_c: Bichrome Tree
---------
From the base level, we can see that try to assign child nodes, so that nodes with same color is as close as possible to the root node x(root) gives min different color value, and min additional weight we added at the same time.

So at each level, we can dp on the choice => should the child use the same color or different color. and we will use the solution where the subset is closest to the root's x(root), and return the complement.

arc085_b: ABS
--------

arc086_b: Non-decreasing
---------

arc087_b: FT Robot
-------

arc088_b: Wide Flip
