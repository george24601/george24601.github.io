387C: George and Number
---------
The answer is number of non-zero digits

570D: Tree Requests
---------
!!!

749D: Leaving Auction
----------
!!!

487B: Strip
----------
Just go greedy to expand band from left to right

260C: Balls and Boxes
----------

432C: Prime Swaps
--------
Calculate all primes <= 10^5, and inverted index for each number. For each number, use bubble sort idea, except that pick the larget prime < distance, and repeats. The prime number is about 10% of all numbers, i.e., we can reduce the distance to 1/10 in each swap => good for 5N requirments

691D: Swaps in Permutation
---------
get all chars and indices in a components, sort the chars and components

35C: Fire Again
---------
Variant of BFS, just keep updating the last.

825D: Suitable Replacement 
--------
Do a bsearch on the final number, find the larget one s.t. number of ?s > missing chars we need to fill

305C: Ivan and Powers of Two
---------
First, preprocess the inputs to remove all duplicates of powers, i.e., for each power, get the count, and then add each binary index to the count of binary + current power

Then we scan from v = 1 to maxV
