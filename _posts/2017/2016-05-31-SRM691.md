Notice that each node has exaclty 1 out edge. The graph would be a tree, with children pointing to the parent, and root pointing to some
random child

Also notice that this n node, n edge is composable structure, so potentially there are multiple components

Now assume only 1 component in the graph.

The graph can be broken down into 2 parts

```
  1. a directed cycle
  
  2. directed trees with roots on that cycle

```

Proof: Induction on the number of vertices, when we add a new edge, which node should it point to?

```
  1. if it points to a vertex on the cycle, it has 3 choices, no incoming edge, incoming edge from cycle, incoming edge from tree

  2. If it points to a vertex on the tree, these 3 choices either introduce more branches, or break the old cycle and introduce a new one
```

Now if the component is just a cycle, then any subset would do => 2^n

If the component is cycle + branch

```
  1. if branches do not change, any subset from cycle will do =>  2^ size(cycle)
  
  2. if branches change, then any non-empty subset from cycle will do => (2^size(branches) - 1) * (2^size(cycle) -1)

  3. sum it up, we get 2^size(component) + 1 - 2^size(branches)
```

Now lets consider the multiple component cases

```
  1. for each component, the argument above still holds, because of the n vertice, n edges structure is composable, except that we have to
exclude empty set case, because each component needs to contribute something to the n node

  2. Therefore, the total # of ways is the product of each indiviual componenets ways - 1 (-1 to exclude empty set case)

  3. therefore, we should DFS the graph to discover the component size and cycle/branch size, and then product result of each component together

```

Implementation notes
-------
```
  1. to calculate size of component, need to convert it to undirected graph

  2. to find the length of the cycle, need to use the directed version, and keep a DFSish clock (See Floyd cycle finding).

  3. 1L << shift to calculate power for long
```
