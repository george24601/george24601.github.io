This is the type of the problem that looks at its inverse - i.e., instead of finding out what moves, find what did not move and its extreme values.

Focus on the unknown, what properties can you infer from the unknown?

```
  1. The unmoved parts, after moves, will be collapsed together, i.e., they must be consecutive numbers

  2. Therefore, # of unmoved <= # of items where consecutive numbers have increasing indices, i.e., max(# of unmoved) <= max(# of consecutive numbers with increasing indices) 

  3. Can the upper bound always be reached? i.e., does that longest sequence give the answer we need?

  4. Then we need to prove max(# of unmoved) >= max(# of consecutive numbers with increasing indices) 

  5. To prove 4), we can argue that we can always construct a solution around that subsequence, easily prove by induction

  6. Therefore, by 2) and 4), we just need to find longest consecutive value sequences with increasing indicies => use the inverse index

```
