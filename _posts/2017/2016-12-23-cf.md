735C: Tennis Championship
-----------
n = 2 , answer = 1

n = 3, answer = 2

Given the max number of games the winner plays, what is the min number of players we need?

g(n +1 ) = g(n) + g(n - 1) => this is the fibonacci sequence starting at n = 2

So we can calcuate fib until the answer > n, and the previous number is the answer

note that we need to keep track of the answer x as well, since we are calculating f(x)



740C: Alyona and mex (!!!)
-----------
When the subarrays have no overlap, trival case, just plug in into each gap, i.e., ans < min length of the subarray, i.e., there is no point putting more than that number in that array

```
	0. Int final answer to 0
	1.  Get all subarrays, and sort by the start index, we also keep track of min gaplength
	2. For each subarray, scan it first to get what elements are populated, and then fill in the blanks with misssing ones

```

What if the input is n = m, and each l = 1 and r = n? This means we can not scan all entries for segment

Therefore, we just construct the array as 0,1,...,ans, 0, 1,...ans. This will make sure any segment of length ans in the answer will have the exact set we need


734D: Anton and Chess
----------
For all 8 differnet lines, keep track the closest one to the king, and its type, and finally decide if it is possible
