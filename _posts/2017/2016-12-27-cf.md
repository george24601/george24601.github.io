Consider the number of spare balloons we can spare

while we can spare more, give more to the next rank, and then delete ones that can be floated, keep going until we have no more to spare, and keep track of the best rank in the mean time

Implmentation-wise, using a double pointer style for-loop is way easier to reason than a while loop, even though while loop seems more intuitive -  took me an hour to figure it out.

This is similar to the first version. However, this approach failed on test 10!!!

The key insight I was missing is that we should only try getting rid of the teams ahead of us. Otherwise, our final rank can not be improved regardless

Algorithm
----------

```
	1. Add all t > k to the priority queue

	2. while we can remove from the PQ, we remove, and update the current k count.

	3. Since now we reduced k count, we need to move pointer further to include more entries > current k

```

724C:  Ray Tracing
-----------

Claim: the ray will always hit a corner

Proof: If not, then we will form a closed loop, however, since we start at a corner, such loop is impossible


Claim: the ray hits each point only once
Proof: If not, then we will have a case where it comes in the oppsoite direciton to where it is from. Since the whole sequence is reversible, this means it will come from a corner and to a corner 

Algorithm
---------
```
	1. For each 2 * n * m points, keep track of when it is first hit
	2. Simulate the process by calculating the next point to hit, and the hit time
	3. For each point, calculate from which x or y axis it is hit, take the earlier point, and add the distance to the answer

```

Note that map<PII, LL> can fit in all cached answers, if we use it to store only reached points


706D:  Vasiliy's Multiset
-----------

Maintain a set for inserted numbers and its count to handle type 1 and 2 request

For type 3 request

```
	1. Use set.lower_bound() to decide if there is entry for the best prefix + 1, with this we can know if it is possible to put 1 bit or 0 bit on that position 

	2. look at the requested number, and pick the opposite number

	3. start with 2^30, all the way to 2^0
```

Note the bitwise operation is a bit tricky. Took me some time to think it through. On our bit search, we have the assumption that this search will yield a number in the set, by induction.
