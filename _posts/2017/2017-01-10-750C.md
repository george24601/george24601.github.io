Idea 1: Math (My approach)
--------------
Maintain an upper and a lower bound. Initially they are set to (-INF, INF), as we go through the rating change in the reverse order, apply the delta to upper/lower bound as long as they are not INF. If we run into a band change, we will do a hard reset if the current value after the rating change is inconsitent with the new band


Idea 2: Bsearch
-------------
Since the problem asks for the max possible value, and input size is 20k, we can try binary search the answer directly, i.e., just use the bsearch to introduce the final answer, and run through the sequence of actions in the reverse order, and see if it is consistent with the band before the contest
