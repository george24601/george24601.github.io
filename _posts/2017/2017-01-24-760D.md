Easy problem, but there is a bug in my code that I was not able to fix it within 10 mins

What I did wrong during contest
--------------
1. should use upper_bound() on vector or sets , instead of implementing my own bsearch

2. Alternatively, should do bottom-up construction, so that we can update pointers to either neighbors in a while loop => added only linear
   cost
