What I did wrong during the contest
--------------
```
I didn't run the second example by hand, or read the second example in text. Therefore, I didn't realize that if two words are both oppsites
of the third word, they will be equivalent.

In the end I spent too much time reasoning about the how to update the hate state efficiently. By the way I realize my mistake it is too
late.

```

To keep track of hates, we just need to keep track of each UF components roots, and note that each member can not have more than 1 hate. 
This makes answering relationship query easier, compared to keeping track of hate at the non-root level


When we try adding (a op b)
-------------
```

1. OppositeA and b will be merged => addEq(OpA, b)

2. OppositeB and a will be merged => addEq(OpB, a)

3. The root of the two's group will be marked as oppsite

4. if any of the above step is invalid, revert the changes

```


When we tray adding (a eq b)
--------------
```

1. we need to add equal to addEq(OpA, OpB) as well

2. each check is to ensure that they do not hate each other already

```

For addEq, we just need to look up in the oppsite array and make sure their parents are not against each other
