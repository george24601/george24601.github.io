If h and g exist, what properties can we infer?!!! 

f(f(x)) = h(g(h(g(x)))) = f(x)

i.e., for all values of f(x), it must be a stable point, i.e., f(vfx) = vfx

Now we just need to construct a solution to prove that as long as f(vfx) = vfx for all vfx presented, we can find g, and h

m >= number of distinct f(x), otherwise, we will have 1 m mapped to 2 f(x)

m <= number of distinct f(x), because for each stable point we discovered, we can assign an m value


Therefore, m = distinct values of vfx. So we define g1(vfx) = index(vfx), and h(index(vfx)) = vfx at that index, i.e. g1 is the inverse of h, and then g = g1 * f


```
h(g(x)) = h * g1 * f(x) = f(x) 

g(h(mx)) = g1 * f(h(mx)) = g1 * f(vmfx)  = g1(vmfx) = index of(vmfx) = mx

```

When implementing, we can just interation all vfx values from 1 to n, if f[vfx] = vfx, we know it is a stable point, and thus we can safely include that in the final answer, because our condition requires only vfx are stable points of f.
