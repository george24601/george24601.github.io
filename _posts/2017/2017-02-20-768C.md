I realize that XOR itself is reversible operation, so I spent too much time finding a sequence of actions than can save some sorting work.

Instead, if you pay attention to the input constraint, the values are only 10^3, therefore, instead of sort the input array directly, we can just keep track of distinct values and their numbers, and brute force simulate the process. Overall run time is O(k * 10^3 * 2), which is enough is for its 4 sec run time bound
