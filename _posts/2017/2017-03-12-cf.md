283B: Cow Program
------------
Just do simultion and cache visited[x][1 or 2] to detect cycle, the overall run time will be O(n) because of the cache


25D: Roads not only in Berland
-----------
```
1. use DFS to detect redundant edges in a tree

2. For each compoent, add that edge to any node in that component (can force order here)
```


274B: Zero Tree
------------
Just start from the root and cascade down


452B: 4-point polyline
-----------
Follow the example, we can see the pattern is a Z-shaped polyline along the diagonal. use this takes top 3 of the 4 longest line segments in the square. 

Alernatively, we can try including both diagonals, and compare results to see which are the best



611D: New Year and Ancient Prophecy(!!!)
-----------
A naive DP solution gives O(n^3), how to improve it?
```
1. Use a prefix sum to calculate total ways(n - l, l1)

2. to do quick comparision, we just need DP to calc the first index where the seg starts at and the seg starts at b are different

```
