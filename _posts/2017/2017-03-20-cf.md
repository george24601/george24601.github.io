770C: Online Courses in BSU
---------------
Build a dependency graph, and then DFS on all k main courses. In the end, order by the post finish time


769C: Cycle in Maze
-------------
Note that we want lexicographically mininal cycle, this means we don't need to find minimal length at all, because to get the lexi graphically smallest cycle, we need to insert D as many times as we can

also note, we want to find cycle with length exactly k, k = mahanttan distance + 2 * number opposite the distances. i.e., given K, we know how many extra D and Ls we can insert, if we know the the shortest path we need to k

So we need to calcualte the shortest path from the desitination to all grids, and then from the starting point, we try inserting D as much as we can, until step + shortestPath(grid) = k, and then L, and then U


785D: Anton and School - 2
----------------
This problem is too hard for me!

Consider when we are at a ( bracket, so we need to know: # of (s before i, and number of )s after i, and any same number combination would work. But I had problem calculating these numbers efficiently, given that input size is 2 * 10^5. 

Turns out there is a closed formula for that! When we have a answer-ish string, i.e., starts with x (s followed by y )s, the total choice is (x+y choose x)

proof: Each of that maps to a pick that opening bracket is not picked, and closing bracket is piked. Easily proof, it is a RSBS, but also, for all possible RSBS, we can find an encoding with such scheme. Therefore, this closed form is correct

Note: since we care only about mods, we can precalculate factorial and calculate the inverse of mod so that we can compute the choices on the fly.
