770C: Online Courses in BSU
---------------
Build a dependency graph, and then DFS on all k main courses. In the end, order by the post finish time


769C: Cycle in Maze
-------------
Note that we want lexicographically mininal cycle, this means we don't need to find minimal length at all, because to get the lexi graphically smallest cycle, we need to insert D as many times as we can

also note, we want to find cycle with length exactly k, k = mahanttan distance + 2 * number opposite the distances. i.e., given K, we know how many extra D and Ls we can insert, if we know the the shortest path we need to k

So we need to calcualte the shortest path from the desitination to all grids, and then from the starting point, we try inserting D as much as we can, until step + shortestPath(grid) = k, and then L, and then U


785D: Anton and School - 2 (TOOHARD)
----------------
The key part is to decompose the problem
