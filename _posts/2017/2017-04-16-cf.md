432D: Prefixes and Suffixes
---------
1. If we have a prefix that matches a suffix, then we have z[i] = n - i

2. To know how many times prefix of length n - i appeared in the substring, we just need to look for number of indecies s.t. z[index] >= n - i 

3. Therefore, we first run z, and then calculate the prefix sum of the inverse array, the answer will be ps[n] - ps[n - i - 1] 

4. Note that in z-algorithm, z[0] = 0, in this case , we need to hard set z[0] = n, so that we don't ignore the whole string case


535D: Tavas and Malekas
-----------
1. If there is no overlap between the end of previous match and start of the next match, we can fill in whatever we want, because what we get is a subsequence, so extra match is OK

2. If there is overlap between the indices, we need to make sure for the overlapped region (next start, previous end), the prefix is same as suffix, Otherwise, the result is invalid  


772D: Volatile Kite
----------
During the contest, I did see the triangle case is enough to infer the insight, and moving the 3 points in a certain direction. But instead of moving them to remove an angle, I tried let 2 points meet first, which proved to be too greedy

If we just want to reduce an angle to a straight line, once we draw the triangle case, it becomes obvious the radius should be half the distance between B and AC, where A, B, C are in clockwise order
