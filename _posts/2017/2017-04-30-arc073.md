What I did wrong during the contest
-----------------
Took me too long to understand the examples and get the algorithm. Just need 10 more mins to finish it successfully!!!

Consider the highest value and lowest value in all balls, obvioiusly they must be selected.

If both are Rs, then we have a candidate for Bmax and Bmin too, we can bsearch on the value of Bmax in the range of [Bmax, highest number in the unselected bad], becasue Bmax the smaller, the better.

```
1. Now we go through other bags, if both balls are outside range of R, bad

2. if one ball is outside range of R, update Bmin for that ball, if ball > Bmax, bad

3. if both are within the range of R, we pick the higher one < Bmin as the choice. If both balls > Bmax, we know it is bad
```

If highest is RMax and lowest is Bmin, we can bsearch on RMin, the idea is similar 

The end result is the smaller of the two
