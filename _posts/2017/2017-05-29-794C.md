Consider the final string will have 2/n chars from each person. Obviously, Oleg will take the smallest n/2 chars, and Igor biggest n/2 chars from their own sets, since we can improve the answer from each's perspective otherwise.

When O is playing

if current O's smallest < I's largest, O will need to fill the left most unoccupied with its own smallest, otherwise I will fill it with largest => not optimal

if current O's smallest >= I's largest, O will need to fill the right most unoccupied with O's largest


When I is playing

if current O's smallest < I's largest, I's largest goes left most

if current O's smallest >= I's largest, I's smallest goes to right most

What I did wrong
-------------
The tie breaker case, the player should not occupy the the leftmost position with their own char, instead, they should try to force the opponent to take that position, while preserve their best candidate for the next round!!!
