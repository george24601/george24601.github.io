Design a unix cron job-like utility

How it is implemented in unix system.

On startup, look for .crontab file in the home folder of all account holders

For each crontab file found, determin the next time in the future each command should run

place those commands in F-M event list with next time to run and "five field" time specifier

In the main loop
        look at the head of queue, and sleep for that period of time
        sleep for tht period of time
        after verifying the correct time, execute the task at the head of the queue (in background) with the privileges of the user who created it
Determine the next time in the future to run this command and place it back on the event list at that time value.


Variations:
1. what if we want to keep track of status, and ensure only one instance is running

2. what if the whole thing is distributed and you want HA?
