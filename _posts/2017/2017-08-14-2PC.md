1. 2PC and concensus protocols(CP) such as Paxos/Raft serve different purposes! 2PC is to ensure ALL parties executed something AT THE SAME TIME, i.e., atomicity. CP is to ensure HA by replication

2. 2PC cohort doesn't release its lock until end of abort/commit. Therefore, other's can not prceed until this 2PC is completed. Hence, the assumption that no permanent failure/partiion, or the transaciton will just hang there!

3. 2PC is the standard way when you want to change state at multiple places at the same time. However, in distributed system, if metadata is centralized and completed separated from data, we can do without 2PC, but we still need clean up routine to handle partial failures 

4. This means to handle interaction between servces, either setting for eventually consistency, or implement 2PC

5. Implmentation wise, during abort, we still need to wait for the return of all aborted response, because we can mark the status

6. Locking on coordinator is needed, to avoid two running the same transcation twice, e.g., between coordinator and GC process. Again, locking can be done either by process lock or lockless MVCC, e.g., timestamp and/or owner name
