Round 58: Palindromic Friendship
---------
we consider both the odd and even case
if (i, i+1) is in the list, then we expand deltas to try the max.
if (i, i+2) is in the list, then we expand deltas to try the max.
each existing relationship will be checked only once. and non-exisitng one is terminal, so the run time will be linear

Round 58: Tournament Swaps
--------
1. easy to generate the FBT, with the winner at each node
2. then we scan trough bottom up (or while we are generating), update max[a[i] +1] = current level, i.e., swap i with i+1, and we want to find the highest level

Official soultion
------
So we need to know the second strongest player. We will just preprocess it to calculate for a give size M, who is the second strong player in for all substrees of size 2^M
