Round 24: Black White Necklace
-----------
pre-calc marble length, then do a two pointer on subarray

Round 24: BST Fixed Height
---------
ways(h) = totalways(h - 1) * ways(h-1)  * 2 
ways(1) = 1

and then update totalWays(h)

Round 23: Permutation Matrix
---------
calculate the cycle of each permutation index. Note that the "intro to cycle" case won't happen!!!
Can use partial sum to speed up computation


Round 23: Disk Mechanism
---------
Note that if we fix the first disk's width, all remaining ones are fixed too

maxR(i) = min(ub(i), x[i] - x[i-1] - minR(i-1))
minR(i) = max(lb(i), x[i] - x[i - 1] - maxR(i-1))

Official solution
------------
Given the first radius X, we can express the each individual radius as X plus list of deltas
so we can calulate the range of each constarint, and take the intersection of all of them!!!


Round 22: Black Shapes
---------
calculate size of each component, for each cell, see if possible to connect to another cell with manhattan distance two
speical case: 

1. full graph already

2. no possible connection

Official solution
--------
Alteratively, we can just iterate through each white cell, and check its neighbors possible from two separate components => and sum-up the answer!!!


Round 21: Max Wave Array
--------
The arragnement would be 1, 3, 2, 5 , 4

Round 20: City Upgrades
--------
bsearch on the max distance, to see if k is enough


Round 20: Stepping Number
-------
We need to answer the q: how many stepping #s <= n. Then we bsearch on the minum number s.t nsn(i) - nsn(n) = k

To calculate # of steping #s <= n, ways(i) = # of stepping number <= n, with the first i - 1 digits a prefix of n, i.e, stepping numbers <= n but >= prefix * base power
ways(n, i) = free(a[i] - 1, size - i) + ways(n, i + 1) 

The final answer is ways(n, 0)

Official dp state
--------
ways(i, j, k) = first i digits, last digit being j, k is 0 or 1, marks if the first i digits is following the prefix
