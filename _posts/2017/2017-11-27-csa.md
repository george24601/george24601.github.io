Round 19: Cities Robbery
---------
four cases:
1. go straight to left

2. go straight to right

3. left and then right

4. right and then left.

We can use either set.upper_bound() or a two-pointer approach


Round 19: Smallest Array Permutation
---------
1. If one # appears > ceil(N/2) times => we have no solution

2. If one # appears = ceil(N/2) times => we have to use this number ONLY IF IT IS ODD!!!

3. Otherwise, we use the minimum number. Can use a heap to keep track of current maximum. Note that the official solution does not use a heap!!!
