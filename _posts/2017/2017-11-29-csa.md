Round 59: Triangular Matrix
---------
We can do a greedy approach. since for each row, we are interested only in the min char, so we record what candidate indices we have, and only take the indices withe min char as the new candidates, and add the min char to the solution

Round 59: Editor
---------
each line must start with a word, therefore, after max 10^5 lines, we will run into a cycle, and we need to quickly answer this question: if this line start at index i, what the index at which the next line starts, and how many first entries we will see on this line?

This can be calculated by a bsearch approach. Of course, we need handle the case where total length < W. 

so we need to know, cycle length, plus how many first entries appeared in this cycle, by keeping track of how many first we have seen before we start this line


Round 18: Squarish Rectangle
---------
brute force search on W 

Round 18: Concatenated String
--------
For each char, we maintain a set of its indices, and then we scan b one by one while maintaining the index at i. If we can not find solution via set.lower_bound(), we reset the current A index to 0

Round 17: To Front - To Back
---------
Find the longest consecutive subsequence, anything not on it must be moved

Round 17: Largest And Subset
---------
Keep a set of candidates, starting from the highest bit. Scan through the candidate to find one with that bit as 1. if there is less than k candidates, we do nothing. Otherwise, we narrow down the scope 


Round 16: Marble Weights
---------
Just weight the 2,3,4,...n subrarray. In the end weigh 1 with n


Round 16: Fake Coins
---------
1. The key is to find an arrangement s.t. 10 and 30 are in two different partitions

2. What is the probability that 10 and 30 will be in the same parititon  => 50% !!!

3. So we just randomly assign coins to two parts, on avg, we expect 2 tried to find them in different paritions

4. After that, it will be standard ternary search
