Round 59: Triangular Matrix
---------
We can do a greedy approach. since for each row, we are interested only in the min char, so we record what candidate indices we have, and only take the indices withe min char as the new candidates, and add the min char to the solution

Round 59: Editor
---------
each line must start with a word, therefore, after max 10^5 lines, we will run into a cycle, and we need to quickly answer this question: if this line start at index i, what the index at which the next line starts, and how many first entries we will see on this line?

This can be calculated by a bsearch. Of course, we need handle the case where total length < W. 

Note that official solution uses a two-pointer method by calculating the mod of total length!!! This works because

1. we reduced to the case where total length >= W, there form the next pointer will never catch up from behind. This is the important gurantee of two-pointer's performance.

2. we know EXACTLY many complete cycle exists, so we just reduce the W and delta between start and end pointer, but the length of this many complete cycles


so we need to know, cycle length, plus how many first entries appeared in this cycle, by keeping track of how many first we have seen before we start this line

```
curstart = 1
ln = 1
while curstart not seen && ln <= H
	seen[curStart] = ln
	next[curStart] = calculateNext(curStart)
	if(nextStart <= curStart){
		numFirst++;
	} 

	numFirst += (W - firstSeg)/TotalLen;
	total[curStart] = numFirst;
	curStart = next[curStart]
	ln++;

if(ln > H){
	return numFirst

}else{
	cycleLen = ln - seen[curStart] 
	numCycle = (H - see[curStart] - 1)/curlcyLen;
	cycleFirst = numFirst - total[curStart - 1]	
	numFirst +=  numCycle * cycleFirst;
	H -= (numCycle - 1) * cycleLen; 
	//repeat the while loop above without bsearch to finish the remaining H
	//alternatively, we can use some formulas
}
```

Round 18: Squarish Rectangle
---------
brute force search on W, since W <= sqrt(S)

Round 18: Concatenated String
--------
For each char, we maintain a set of its indices, and then we scan b one by one while maintaining the index at i. If we can not find solution via set.lower_bound(), we reset the current A index to 0

However, this implicitly dependes on the size of S, may still be too slow!!!  To key insight is that since we keep moving pointer to the right, we can speed up by keeping track of current index, and ignore all index < current index

We will just pre-compute next(i, c) = at index i, what the next index of char c. To calcualte it, we need to keep track of last seen char index, and upgrade everything between the last seen one, but before the current one


Round 17: To Front - To Back
---------
Find the longest consecutive subsequence, anything not on it must be moved. To calculate it, we can just keep track of the seen index of the number, and the length of consecutive subsequence of it.

Round 17: Largest And Subset
---------
Keep a set of candidates, starting from the highest bit. Scan through the candidate to find one with that bit as 1. if there is less than k candidates, we do nothing. Otherwise, we narrow down the scope 


Round 16: Marble Weights
---------
Just weight the 2,3,4,...n subrarray. In the end weigh 1 with n

Official solution
---------
3 weights to find w1, w2, and w3, and then we can weigh w1 with w4...w5...w6


Round 16: Fake Coins
---------
1. The key is to find an arrangement s.t. 10 and 30 are in two different partitions

2. What is the probability that 10 and 30 will be in the same parititon  => 50% !!!

3. So we just randomly assign coins to two parts, on avg, we expect 2 tried to find them in different paritions

4. After that, it will be standard ternary search
