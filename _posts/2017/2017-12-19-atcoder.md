arc065_b: Connectivity
----------
Do a flood fill on road to decide which city goes to which component, and then flood fill again on rail roads, but add the edge only if the two nodes are in the same components

Official solution handles a and b separately, and test of (a,b) are the same!!!

agc008_b: Contiguous Repainting
--------
The final form must have a continons block of black or white of length >= K. 

So we just try all i, and candidates are positives in [0, i), [i+k, n], max(sum[i, i+k), 0))

agc008_c: Tetromino Tiling
-------
Note that only I, O, J, L matters. if I is odd, and give that extra to a J, L combo. Note official solution needs to try the number of I + J + L patterns!!!

agc010_b: Boxes
---------
We can caluate exactly how many ops we performed O. if a2 - a1 = O, we know that no ops NOT in a1. Conversely, suppose we have O1 opes on a1, then the a2 - a1 = -O1 * (n-1) + O - O1,i.e., we can infer how many ops are on a1 . 

Note:

1. the formula suggests that k - d(i) = n * x => we need to check the dividability here.

2. that sum of d(i)s is 0 => sum of (k - d(i))/n = k 


agc011_b: Colorful Creatures
--------
sort the value, for each i, check if there is an iterm s.t., a(j) > 2 * ps(i)
