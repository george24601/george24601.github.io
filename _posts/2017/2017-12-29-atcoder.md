arc081_c: Don't Be a Subsequence
--------
Start from empty string, try finding the first index where all a-z are included. If unable to find it before the end of the string, we have an answer. Otherwise, reset indices, and repeat the process 

arc081_d: Flip and Rectangles
--------
Consider the easier version: if there is no change, how do you find the black rectangle with the larget area?!!!

arc083_c: Bichrome Tree
---------
From the base level, we can see that try to assign child nodes, so that nodes with same color is as close as possible to the root node x(root) gives min different color value, and min additional weight we added at the same time.

So at each level, we can dp on the choice => should the child use the same color or different color. and we will use the solution where the subset is closest to the root's x(root), and return the complement.

arc085_b: ABS
--------
Claim: A can not get better result than taking all but last or last in the first step!!!
Proof: If A takes less than second last in the first move, and can achieve better result, then B can take the last or second last instead, which blocks A's moves

arc086_b: Non-decreasing
---------
If |minV| > |maxV|, add minV to all, and do a rolling add from n to 1. Otherwise, add maxV to all, and do a rolling add from 1 to n.

arc087_b: FT Robot
-------
Standard coding problem.

arc088_b: Wide Flip
-------
bsearch on K, at each K guess, do a greey conversion, start at the leftmost 1, and issue a flip, to improve the speed, use an even-based approach.
