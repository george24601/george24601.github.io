arc081_c: Don't Be a Subsequence
--------
Start from empty string, try finding the first index where all a-z are included. If unable to find it before the end of the string, we have an answer. Otherwise, reset indices, and repeat the process 

Official solution
----------

1. Use dp to caluate the length of target subsequence len[i] = min(len(next(i, c))) + 1

2. start from 0, find the smallest char c, s.t., len[i] = len(next(i,c)) + 1, and then update i


arc083_c: Bichrome Tree
---------

Official solution
-----------

arc085_b: ABS
--------
Claim: A can not get better result than taking all but last or last in the first step!!!
Proof: If A takes less than second last in the first move, and can achieve better result, then B can take the last or second last instead, which blocks A's moves

arc086_b: Non-decreasing
---------
If |minV| > |maxV|, add minV to all, and do a rolling add from n to 1. Otherwise, add maxV to all, and do a rolling add from 1 to n.

arc087_b: FT Robot
-------
Standard coding problem. Note that for the each of coding, we can handle x and y separately!!!

arc088_b: Wide Flip
-------
bsearch on K, at each K guess, do a greey conversion, start at the leftmost 1, and issue a flip, to improve the speed, use an even-based approach.

Official solution
