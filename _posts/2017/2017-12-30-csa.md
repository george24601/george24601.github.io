Round 61: Paint the Fence
----------
Even-based approach, looking for the fence with layer 0.

Partial-sum approach
-----------

Round 61: Strictly Increasing Array
----------
If we are looking for a non-decreasing array, we just need to find LCS. However, we can not use it directly, as we know A(j) - A(i) >= j - i, in the LCS we found!!!

So we just do a reduction, i.e., A(j) -j >= A(i) - i, this reduces to our LCS problem.


Round 62: Simple Paths
----------
Find the first path from A to B, mark all discovered edges as bad. Then run again, while ignoring the blacklist.

Official solution

Round 62: Partial Maximums
---------
Do a rolling start, keep track of top 2 numbers. For each number, track if it is already max, only 1 greater, or 2 greater than that. If only 1 greater than the current number, that greater number count++.

In the end, we just looking the number with max count, plus all number that is already max.

Official solution
