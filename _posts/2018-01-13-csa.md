Round 63: Find Remainder
---------
Find GCD of all deltas, then find the smallest prime divisor of this  delta

Round 63: Graph Game
---------
The key insight is that # of even deg vs has the same oddity as total # of vs,

Therefore, suppose N is even, A will always pick the scenario with even # of even degs, B will always pick the scenario with odd # of even degs, i.e., B can not lose => A always loses!!!

Conversely it is true for the odd case


Round 64: Create Tree
---------
Just check them one by one

Round 64: Limited Moves
----------
1. Obviously, the first move has to move less than N/2 entries, plus, we can not leave an even # after the first step. Otherwise, B will just force 1 

2. So at each step, we just pick the highest number s.t., after the removal, there is only odd number of entries. The pick < N/2, and <= previous round. Make sure we try take all case
