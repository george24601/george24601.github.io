509C: Sums of Digits
----------
need to know minGood[i], suppose we know minGood[i-1]

if b(i) > b(i - 1), then a(i) must be of form prefix + (some digit >= corresponding digit)99999, so we can try all prefixes, scanning from right to left

if b(i) < b(i - 1), then a(i) must be of form prefix + (some digit >= corresponding digit)000000, so we can try all prefixes, scanning from right to left

O(n^3) run time, because we have to represent the number as a string

374C:Inna and Dima
----------
Use 4 step BFS to find the edges between D nodes => 4 * 3 * 3 < 40 mil edges max

We can find an edge, we can can use a union find to see if the vs are within the same component, if so, then cycle. 

In the end, calculate longest path in each tree 


264C:Choosing Balls

353D:Queue

592D:Super M
