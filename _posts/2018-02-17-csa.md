Round 68: Right Triangles 
------------
A variant of Fenwick tree


Round 68:  Triangular Updates
-----------
For the banded updates, one technique is to convert the original array to an delta array. The main benefit is that update can be translated to exactly 2 updates instead of variable sizes => the original items will be recovered by calculating the prefix sum of the delta array.

This problem has similar idea, except that to retrieve the items, prefix sum is diagonal


Round 69: Build Correct Brackets
----------
n^2 DP. So at each step we can 

1. change the whole substring to (()) form, cost can be calculated by prefix sum

2. find k s.t., i...k are of from (), and k+1...j has at least ()s 

3. update mincost and # of ways as we go


Round 69: Cover the Tree
----------
We have to introduce a new branch at every turn of DFS.

Therefore, for every two children, we combine the two returned paths, and add to the output

For the possible remaining children's path, we add p-> c to the list, and return
