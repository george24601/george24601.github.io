931D: Peculiar apple-tree
-----------
Claim: if a level has an odd # of apples, it will contribute an apple in the end!!!

Proof: by induction on levels, when we move the apple to the level above, the cancel rule means the oddity is preserved. => at the root level, even means empty, odd means 1 => so all even cases lead to cancel at the root

937D: Sleepy Game
------------
We need to find a path, s.t .

1. even length

2. the final node has no outgoing edges 

So we assign a node into two cases: arriving at the node, with the oddity of the path traveled so far, and build a graph!!!

So we just do a DFS, and try find one such paths, and also keep track of existance of cycles, so that we can ensure that we can keep at least a draw

940D: Alena And The Heater
------------
for each new digit we processed, we can see that

1. 11110 case, up can push down ub of r

2. 00001 case, we can inc ub of l

3. 11111 case, we can increase lb of r

4. 00000 case, we can dec up of l

5. if the last 4 digits are not 0000 or 1111, we can not infer anything

In the end, we take ub of r and lb of l, see if they intersects


946D: Timetable
-----------
Official answer uses naive dp, although i doubt it will pass the run time check

950C: Zebras
----------
Simple greedy solution would work

950D: A Leapfrog in the Array
-----------
Hard problem for me!!!

Odd position will get (p+1)/2

Even position: iterate over previous even position until we reach an odd position which is a base case 

948D: Perfect Security
-----------
Use trie to optimize the O(n^2) solution
