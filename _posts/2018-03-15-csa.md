Round 70: Min Distances
------------
the classic shortest path relationship is that minD(a, b) = min (a, c) + min(c, b) over all cs 

Note that when we can't find c that satifies such relationships, either our graph is invalid, or a,b is direct!!!

so we just populate matrix and re-run f-w

Round 71: Binary Differences
------------
Claim: the set must be continous

Proof: suppose we find the max diff, we can keep taking off left and right end and reduce the diff by 0, 1, or 2, as we like

so we can just find the max and min possible k value

Round 71: Russian Dolls
----------
easy to calculate # will gain by reducing to the next level, and keep track of the max # we have seen so far, we stop, when the new # >= seen

Round 72: Beautiful Matrix
------------
only 4 possible cases
1. swaping top row

2. swapping bottom row

3. swapping left col

4. swapping right col 


Round 72: Spring Cleaning
-------------
Easy case anaylsis - either path or cycle


Round 73: Binary Isomorphism
-----------
All trees can be swapped, yet # of 1 child node, 0 child node, 2 child nodes remains same, and all swaps are reversible. So we can categorize them into the same signature class
