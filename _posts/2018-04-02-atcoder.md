arc093_b: Grid Components
---------
We just a grid with 41 rows, and 100 columns

row 0 - 20, fill with #

row 21 - 41, fill with .

for each additional ., iterate to add to (2i, 2j)

for each additional #, iterate to add to (21 + 2i, 21 + 2j)


agc022_b: GCD Sequence
--------
Overall, a hard problem for me!!!

Note that the constraint is equivalent of saying gcd(a(i), S) != 1

Note that we have to pick about 2/3 of all numbers, so we can define S to be multiple of small primes => S = 6K 

So we pick 6K + 2 , 6K + 3, 6K + 4, and 6K, and make sure we pick 2, 3 to force all gcds = 1

Note that N <= 5 case is different from N >= 6 case.
