1. Persuading bigger team is MUCH harder than the smaller teams, but working with people IS the work in a people-organization! 

2. Social proof often matters as much, if not more, than facts and logics.

3. Presentation matters! It can change people's view even if there is nothing they don't already know

4. When getting a "NO", ask what you need to do to get a "YES", and ideally let the other side commit on that.

5. Basic principle: short feedback loop so that you can gain momentum for your work

6. Find who might support you, pitch your ideas to them individually, and gather them together so that you can have a self-reinforcing concensus.
