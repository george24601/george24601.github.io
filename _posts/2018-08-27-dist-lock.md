# Requirements

1. only 1 thread holds the lock

2. no dead lock

3. can be blocked, and can be waken up from blocked status

4. Note that it is almost impossible to achieve 1 and 2 at the same time (See the analysis below). Normally it becomes a tradeoff.

# Redis

1. set expiry time on lock

2. record lock holder to prevent unlocking by mistake

3. compare and unlock is done in an atomtic action

Problem:

1. TTL is hard to set it right

2. Master - slave replication may lose data

# Zookeeper

1. Zookeeper has official lock recipe. Also checkout Apache curator

2. heartbeat to prevent dead lock

3. caller thread can be blocked, and will be waken up via Watch

Problem: lost heartbeat from old caller will trick ZK server to release the lock too early - the caller process itself is still up
