### pre-giving

* Give a small favor, ideally something physical, before persuation 

* Don't wait too long between favor and persuation

### foot-in-the-door 

* The smaller request in the similar domain followed by the larger (and larger) requests 

* The inital request should not have too much external incentives, to avoid the overjustification symptom

* Note that this technique is most useful when the person's self-image aligns with your persuation,i.e., from yes to bigger yes, instead of no to yes 

* Another scenario is waiting for a person's acknowledgement before 


### Door-in-the-face

* Almost the inverse of FITD. This is one from no to yes.

* But similar to FITD, should not wait long between the two requests, although some research points out the opposite

### Low-ball

* Paint a pleasant mental picture as if the customer can get it with reduced price, even if we intend to sell it at higher price 

* The key is that pleasant mental picture should buy initial agreement, and the second one should not be too outrageous

* Similar to bait-and-switch, but low-ball is more on money and single interaction, bait and switch has separate bait and actual sales activity
