* If we engage behaviours we didn't expect to do, our thoughts and feelings are likely to change 

* Too much reward/penalty may lead to over justitifcation, i.e., a person may think it is more because of external reasons instead of internal reasons.

* Praise focuses on the internal of activity, i.e., makes us feel good about ourselves due to our accomplishments, is more likely to increase our performance and the liking of the activity

* When we review our past activity, and decide that we are not going to do anything different, this is often a sign of reducing congitive disssonance, i.e., makes us feel less bad about ourselves - but also introduces bias!

* Given too many choice, people may worry more about oppurtunity cost, and thus creates cognitive dissonance - a free gift is better than choosing between the two!
