### Objective

1. In a single sentence, qualitative goal
2. Should be inspirational, not conform to status quo or describe business as usual
3. the goal should be time bound, but not too long
4. Try setting only one


### Key Results

1. most often three
2. quantitative metrics to meature if objective has been reached by the end of the period, should include evidence of completion
3. difficult but not impossible, i.e., 50% of failing, as if it is truly random
4. something happened because of something you did => describe impacts instead of activities
5. can be time-related if not by default end of the whole period
7. Don't give different weights to key results even though they contribute different level of values=> it is about tendency, not perfection
1. much of the value in OKRs comes from the conversation on what matters
2. baking OKR into weekly meetings and weekly status mail
3. DO NOT CHANCE OKR, let it fail and set better goal next time
4.  If you can't keep on track longer than a week. Then you are not ready for OKR yet. This is especailly true for startups. OKR should be reviewed weekly or biweekly to ensure focus and progress
5. Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes
6. rather than using a single number, the best assessment is usually a set of measurements. By choosing multiple metrics, we can design a solution without the unintended consequences that occur when optimizing for a narrow objective.
