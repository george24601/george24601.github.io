645D:Robot Rapping Results Report
----------
Variant of longest path from root of a DAG

494B: Obsessive String
----------
Hard problem for me!!!

First, use KMP to find all possible mapping points


689D: Friends and Subsequences
----------
Segment tree related

769D:k-Interesting Pairs Of Integers
---------
10^8 brute force

222D:Olympiad
----------
1. Since there is no upper bound, we can always take first

2. To calculate lower bound, we just sort both runs, and run a two pointer with one moving from from L to R, one from R to L 

3. if curSum >= x, move both closer, increase the count, else, move the lower bound up. Final answer is the count


622D:Optimal Number Permutation
-----------
Easy construction exists for a total zero sum!!!

601B:Lipshitz Sequence
-----------
Hard problm for me
