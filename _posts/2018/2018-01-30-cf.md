918C: The Monster
--------
For each i,
we start scannning from right to left, and keep track of how many free ?'s we have, and how many (, we have

if size of stack is empty, but we have ( incoming, reduce ?, if nothing to reduce, we know we are bad already
if size of stack + free ? % 2 = 0, we add sum[i - j] to sum [i]

The final result is the sum[0]  to sum[j]

918D: MADMAX
-------
standard DAG dp, with state[A'v][B's][last char][A moves now]

Note the first step is special, don't include them in the DP state

770C:Online Courses In BSU
---------
Standard DP on DAG problem

613B:Skills
---------
1. check if possible to fill all skills to max level

2. The final form is that some mininum are raises, and some are increased to max numbers, we know that

a. if incrase all mins by 1, the increased cm  <  cf

b. if increase a skill to A, then increase cf < increaseing the min cm

3. Therefore, we can calculate the cost to make the min K aligned together

4. After that, we try filling max number one by one, and given the pre-computatin, we know exactly the max min value we can reach, so each fill step can be calcualted in O(logN)

652C: Foe Pairs
----------
keep track of current index at 0, maintain a heap that sorted by end and the start

Keep popling the heap

1. if the curStart >= curIndex, add curEnd - startIndex, and then update curIndex to curStart + 1

2. in the add add n - startIndex

919D: Substring
----------
1. if it has cycle, can be infinitely large

2. otherwise, it becomes longest path on the tree problem, once for each letter

788B: Weird journey
----------
Hard problem for me - uses facts about Euler graph

117C: Cycle
----------
Do a dfs, while maintain an index on the current DFS path, every time we reach an "visiting" node, we can check if that node's index = current Index - 2
