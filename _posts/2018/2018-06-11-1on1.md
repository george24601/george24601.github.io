1. Minimum: 30 mins every two weeks. Try best to stick with plan, and mentally prepared for that.

2. Don't ask "How are things?" - you should know this through normal standups. Instead, focus on

```

Company direction

Career development

Conflict resolution

Constructive feedback

```

3. Spent first 10 mins to discuss company-team wise issues, to pass the context down to the team

4. After that, Give feedback on performance and their individual goals

5. Leave the end chunk to questions and discussions. Very likely you don't have answers to questions on the spot - take notes and follow up later

6. May consider walking meeting to help relaxation.
