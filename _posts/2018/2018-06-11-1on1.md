1. Minimum: 30 mins every two weeks. Try best to stick with plan, and mentally prepared for that.
2. Don't ask "How are things?" - you should know this through normal standups. Instead, focus on
  * Company direction
  * Career development
  * Conflict resolution
  * Constructive feedback
3. Spent first 10 mins to discuss company-team wise issues, to pass the context down to the team
4. After that, Give feedback on performance and their individual goals
5. Leave the end chunk to questions and discussions. Very likely you don't have answers to questions on the spot - take notes and follow up later
6. May consider walking meeting to help relaxation.

### On diffcult talk

* Positive visioning. Before the conversation, think about your ideal outcome. Itâ€™s very possible that the conversation will go much better than you initially thought.
* Create talking points beforehand, but no script - you want to avoid monologue
* SLOW DOWN. Disengage after one becomes defensive
* Look at the person's face!
