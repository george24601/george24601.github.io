1. Overall goal is to deliver value to the customer, not to build a perfect product, i.e., we have to be aware of the oppurtiny cost of doing so!

2. Product owner (PO) needs to neigotiate quality cutoff line with the dev team

3. Fix the defect from current sprint's user stories. Otherwise, the backlog is not considered done! However, if the defect is not from the current spring, much more debatable (see blow) 

4. Fixing defect is more of a "now or never" mentality. If the defect is critial enough, most likely it will manifest itself again. Otherwise, the issue will rarely manifest, and  we can probably close the issue with a "won't fix". However, we also have to keep in mind that the later we fix the defect, the more expensive it becomes

5. For quick defect fixes, we may squeeze it into the current sprint. For bigger defects, we can put it in the backlog, and delete it if it lasts over two sprints  - need to keep backlog short!
