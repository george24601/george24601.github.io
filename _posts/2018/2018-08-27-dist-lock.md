# Requirements

1. only 1 thread holds the lock

2. no dead lock

3. can be blocked, and can be waken up from blocked status

4. Note that it is almost impossible to achieve 1 and 2 at the same time (See the analysis below). Normally it becomes a tradeoff.

## Redis

1. set expiry time on lock
2. record lock holder to prevent unlocking by mistake
3. compare and unlock is done in an atomtic action
4. Timeshift,e.g., NTP may trick early release

### Problem:

1. TTL is hard to set it right
2. Master - slave replication may lose data

## Zookeeper

1. Zookeeper has official lock recipe. Also checkout Apache curator
        * create a smallest ordered number in a lock dir
	* listen for the smallest value in that lock dir if it exsits already for its deletion event
 	* On that listened val's deletion, ask again if it is holding the lock 
	* On releasing the lock, delete ordered number created in the first setp
2. heartbeat to prevent dead lock
3. caller thread can be blocked, and will be waken up via Watch
4. Problem: lost heartbeat from old caller will trick ZK server to release the lock too early - the caller process itself is still up
