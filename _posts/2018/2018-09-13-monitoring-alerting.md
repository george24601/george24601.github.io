* Feel free to add alerts, but only page when the symptom impacts user or the user-facing impact is very likely to ensue.
* For alerts requires intervetion but not right away, email and slack is enough.
* We highly recommend you select "Do Not Require" for sparse metrics, otherwise some evaluations will be skipped - but this may trigger more false alarms if the window is too short
* One idea is to create a composite monitor, one for the errorneous data, and one for the amount of data, and the alert fires only when both are satisfied
* Datadog generally recommends against using interpolation for count/rate metrics in monitors, i.e., interpolation works only with gauge metrics
* Short evaluation window means even shorter time buckets. In monitors with division over short evaluation windows. If metrics for the numerator and denominator arenâ€™t both available at query time, you could get unwanted evaluation values.
