1. Volatile forces the program to write the value immediately to the memory in an atomic action by passing cpu cache. reading bypasses CPU cache too, or force the CPU cache to expire early

2. This means if we have only one writer, and all reader/writers are volatile, then the program is thread safe. However, it is not true if you have more than one writer

3. Visibility rule: if the thread reads a volatile value, then ALL variables visible to the thread will be re-read from the memory. This means the order of instructions matter! If you have read AFTER the volatile read, or it got reordered by the compiler, than the vars after the volatile is NOT affected. Luckily, JVM prevents this

4. Note ++ is a syntactic sugar, it is compiled into a read-update-write operation - so you can't use volatile with it!

### Java singleton with volatile

```java

public class Singleton {

private voltile Singleton _instance;

private Singleton() {
}

private Singleton getInstance() {

	if (_instaance == null) {
		synchronized(Singleton.class) {
			_instance = new Singleton();
		}
	}

	return _instance
}

}
```
