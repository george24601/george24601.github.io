### From Jeff Dean

1. mutex lock/unlock is around the same range as RAM access - 0.1 ms

2. Reading 1 MB sequentially from RAM - 0.25 ms

3. Round trip between DC - 0.5 ms

4. Reading 1 MB from network 10 ms

5. Reading 1 MB sequentially from disk 30 ms, excluding seek time

6. Roundtrip between CA and Netherland is 150ms

### SSD vs Traditional HD

* Disk seek is 10ms on traditional, 0.1 ms on SSD

* SSD is log-structured and has lots of errors, but masked on the on-device logic. Hard to survive multiple power outages but average failure time > 6 years

* for SSD, seq write improves throughput and latency is roughly same. Seq read and random read has roughly same throughput and latency

* For traditional disk, writing has similar performance as read, but need to add full rotation + blocksize/transfer rate

* Data transfer rate between 100MB/s to 600MB/s on SSD, < 140MB/s on HD
