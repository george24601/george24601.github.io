1. mutex lock/unlock is around the same range as RAM access - 100 ns = 0.001 ms. L2 access at 7ns
2. Reading 1 MB sequentially from RAM - 0.25 ms.
3. Round trip between DC - 0.5 ms
4. Reading 1 MB from network 10 ms
5. Reading 1 MB sequentially from disk 30 ms, excluding seek time. Sequential read 1GB/s for SSD, 4GB/s for memory. Random read 4KB from SDD is about 0.15ms
6. Roundtrip between CA and Netherland is 150ms. SF to NYC is about 40ms
7. Disk seek is 10ms on traditional, 0.1 ms on SSD.
8. Compressing 1K bytes with Zippy is in the same range as sending 1k bytes over 1 Gbps network - 0.01ms
9. Each day has 86.4k seconds, although during estimate we probably want to use 40k instead of 80k to take sleep time into account.
10. Tomcat can handle 1200 QPS per instance, DB can handle 500 QPS no problem. For cache, more often than not is the bandwidth than QPS

* SSD is log-structured and has lots of errors, but masked on the on-device logic. Hard to survive multiple power outages but average failure time > 6 years
* for SSD, seq write improves throughput and latency is roughly same. Seq read and random read has roughly same throughput and latency. 
* For traditional disk, writing has similar performance as read, but need to add full rotation + blocksize/transfer rate
