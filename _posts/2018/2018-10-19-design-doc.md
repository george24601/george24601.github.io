Mostly based on [this doc](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-a-good-software-design-document-66fcf019569c)

### Common sections

* Reviewers to sign off
* Motivation 
  * Non-dev should be able to read it
  * Show how the project is tied to the long-term goals
* Overview
  * Read by all engineers to decide if they need to keep reading
  * 3 paragraphs max
* Context
* Goals 
  * in the dimension of user-driven impact
  * measuable key results
* Non-goals
* Milestones
  * For PM and manager's manager to quick read
* Current solution
  * Probably need to include user stories (from different povs) to show how the solution behaves dynamically
* Proposed solution
  * Probably need to prototype before you are able to propose
  * Details go here. Use user stories to show how the system behaves
  * Include precise pseudo code and data structure
  * Someone didn't write the doc but understands the problem should be able to implement the solution 
* Alternative Solutions
* Monitoring and Alerting
  * Probably include correctness invariant and testing strategy. Testing strategy needs to be detailed too
* Cross-Team Impact
* Discussion
  * If the discussion has more than 5 comments, in-person discussion is probably better
* Detailed Scoping and Timeline
  * By engineers, tech lead, and managers, that is why it is near the end of the doc
