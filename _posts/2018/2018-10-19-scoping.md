Mostly based [on this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-effectively-scope-your-software-projects-from-planning-to-execution-e96cbcac54b9)

* Update the scope throughput the project. Most likely you need to update your estimate after each milestone 
* Set up milestones and check points. Ideally, milestones should enable partial launch of the project
* De-risk the project ASAP, by focusing on the risk part and prototyping and scaffolding
* Scoping is the task for engineers, not PMs or managers
* Try hard not to underscope
* Each task step should take 2-3 days max
* 1.5x of your estimated dev time to include buffer for interrupt tasks
* Timebox open-ended questions and commit to a solution within the box, but be aware of trade-off between time box and long term cost 
* Dropping the project or stop it right after certain milestone is an option too.
