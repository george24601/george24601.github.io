* File IO
* Signals, e.g., SIGTERM, SIGSTOP
* Socket - a form of file descriptor
  * Uses socket descriptor as handle. Underlying it associates with IP + port combo of LOCAL node
  * a concept used mostly in the transport layer
* Unix domain sockets. similar to the internet socket, but all communications happens with the kernel. Referred to by the process as inode
* MQ in the OS
* Pipe
  * parent process creates the anonymous pipe, and let the child process inherit it
  * appearts to be normal FD, but no seek capability
  * In Unix, processes of the same pipe are started at the same time. The buffering ensures that no data is lost 
* Named pipe. appears as a file. Processes use it instead of standard streams
* Shared memory, e.g., mmap file
* Memory-mapped file.
  * In most operating systems the memory region mapped actually is the kernel's page cache (file cache), meaning that no copies need to be created in user space
  * In the IPC context, normally it is non-persist file, i.e., when the last process is finished the data is lost
  * The memory-mapped approach has its cost in minor page faultsâ€”when a block of data is loaded in page cache, but is not yet mapped into the process's virtual memory space
  * Aside from the popular IPC usage, most common usage is the process loader
