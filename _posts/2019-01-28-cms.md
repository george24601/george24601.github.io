Goal:  shortest stop the world time.

* tag objects directed referenced by GC roots
* Remark: fix changed introduced during the concurrent tag stage
* By default GC thread 3 = (CPU + 3) /4
* Still need to mark & sweep for old ge
* Old gen will have frag problem that may trigger full gc too much
* New gen GC strategy is same as ParNew

1. STW, init mark: mark old gen objects DIRECTLY reachable from the GC root, and old gen objects referred by the new gen.
2. Concurrent mark: use GC root tracing to tag all garbages, user thread still running
3. Pre-sweep: tag old gen survival objects
4. Interruptable pre-sweep
5. STW: retag, scan GC roots + new gen + old gen objects with dirty cards
6. concurrent sweep: mark unreachable object
7. concrrent reset: reset gc state and enter the next GC cycle
