Notes on "Never Split the Difference" by Christopher Voss and Tahl Raz.

* Myself is analytical, which is the worst type match with assertives. Analyst type does not enjoy "What"/"How" questions, maybe need to find a way to spar it?
* To assertives, getting things done is more important than making it perfect. 
* They need to think you understand them before listening to your pov
* They will keep talking on every moment of slience. This leaves the room for mirroring technique
  * Use a slow, calm voice to create authority and trustworthiness. Note this voice is normally used to make a point and should NOT be the default voice 
  * "I'm sorry..."
  * Repeat the last 3 words or the last critical 1-3 words of what the assertive just said
  * Keep slient and let the other side speak. This also helps reveal their strategy 
  * Rinse and repeat if needed 
* Try NOT to offer trade-offs/reciprocity, because assertives will ask for more. Conversely, if they give up something, they expect something equal or more in return.
* Get "That's right" from them, because that is a sign they FEEL they own the conclusion.
  * On the other hande, "you are right" means almost nothing, and should not definitely taken as sign of progress
  * I will try. You are right = I plan to fail. In this case, drill again with a "how" when you get a "that's right"
* When the negotiation is going off-track/losing focus, just invite them to re-engage
