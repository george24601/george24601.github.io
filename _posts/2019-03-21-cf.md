### 1118D2: Coffee and Coursework (Hard Version)

Bsaerch on the number of days, and then just take the highest (number of days) of coffee, minus the ones, not contributing  

### 1017D: The Wu
Note that we have only 2^12 possible choices, so we can just pre-compute the answer for 2^24 = 16 mil iterations

### 500D: New Year Santa Network

For each edge, calculate how likely it is appear in a path between (a, b). For every delta, reduce the result by 3 * delta * probablility

### 405D: Toy Sum

The greedy intuition is easy, but I was stuck at proving it!!!

Claim: We can always find a solution if and only if size of X is no longer than half of S

Proof: 

1. If n > S/2, the lower bound of X is higher than the upper bound

2. If n LTE S/2,  Suppose X has A symmetric pairs, then the remaining possible symmetric pair numbers are s/2 - A - (n - A) = s/2 - n + 2A. If we add the constraint in, we can see that we just have enough "idle" pairs!!!  

### 615D: Multipliers

just calculate for each number, how many times it can appear in a divisor, (m) * 2^(n-m)-1, need to precompute that to be linear
