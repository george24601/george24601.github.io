### 961D: Pair Of Lines 

Take first two points, and see if they can form a candidate line, and then the remaining dots must be on a different line 

If does not work, then the third point must be on the same line as either first or second point.

To check if a, b, c are on the same line, calculate 2d CROSS PRODUCT of (b- a) * (c - a), will be 0 if (b - a) and (c - a) are colinear!!!


### 1012B: Chemical table

Covert a cell into an edge in bipartite graph!!!

For every path of length 3 we can create a fusion, and we can replace the fusion by reducing the total # of edges by 2.

If a component is connected, we must be able to find a path of length 3, then we can just find the longest path and keep performing the fusion, until max length of path is 2, i.e., simple components

Between simple components, we just need one additional edge to create a new component

### 702D: Road to Post Office

Regardless of the input value, just get the min of 4 cases: all walk, all drive, drive until the last seg and then walk, drive first leg and then walk


### 853B: Jury Meeting

Two pointer on k segments, on each day, we need to update, for each jury, the cheapest arrival rate (lower), the cheapest departure date (higher), is it enough the satify all requirement, what is the current cost
