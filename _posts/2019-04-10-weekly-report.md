Common parts:

* Date and list of stakeholders
* Previous's week's plan 
* This week's progress
* Next week's plan


### Previous's week's plan 

* Quote objectives, as reminder to the management. Keep it CONCISE

### This week's progress

* May order by status, keep list of completed milestones, may keep them at the front, espeically if it is ahead of schedule.
* What issues and challenges did we run into? What need to be addressed?
* Any part of context we need to update? Include both before value and after value
* What results, not effort, did we get?
* If possible, include completion percetage and scheduled completion date. Note that status (is it on track?) is more important than progress
* Organize by projects, NOT employee's tasks!
* Mention projects even if it has NO progress
* May use metric dashboards and other visualization tool when there are too many metrics.
* Maintain a daily log on activities 
* Do not wait for better result. Send report in-schdule, and we can update in person later.
* Focus on accompolishments than tasks! Task is for ICs!

### Next week's plan

* Objectives for the next week. Should include all items from the "In Progress" section
* May include important events, e.g., meetings
* Milestones should be SHARP, we can even trade being measurable for sharpness 
* May include relationship with long term goals


* Managers shall not just read, but make comments in the employee's report. Giving employees feedback is crucially important.
* Weekly report is an effective way to get credits. Also, improves your visibility
* Send it 24 hours before the report
