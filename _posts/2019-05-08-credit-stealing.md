* Fight only the most importatnt battles. Not getting all credits you deserve is a fact of working in a team.
  * Do NOT act on impulse. Think how this will affect you in the next 2-5 years. Fight only on those with long term consequence
* Credit stealing, e.g., the "I" tone, may be unintended or even well-intended. 
  * He may want to take the ownership of the whole thing - both success and failure, 
  * He may want to attach his name to get more buy-ins
* As self-protection, create paper trails and involve other people early
* During 1 on 1, raise that you want more visibility, and want chances to present ideas as my own. 
  * Make sure you remain neutral and non-confrontational.
  * Stick with positive sandwich!
* "Tell her how proud you are of other team members for their specific contributions, and how those are helping her. Over time it will help her see more of the benefits of giving credit; how savvy that makes you look; and how indispensable a team is to her own success." Against insecure manager
* Praise the manager in public if he is seeking visibiity, while silping in your own contribution ("I" tone is acceptable here)
* Set yourself up as the information source. Let other people know that they can find details from you
* If hiring manager asks why you left, answer honestly, but with emphasis on fairness and cooperation, and your action only demonstrates ethics and personal direction
* Plan idea out as if it got buy-in already, and present the detailed solution. (Similar to foot-in-the-door apporach?)
* Prepare additonal data not included in presentation, and slip it in during the presentation. The goal is to set you up as the expert
