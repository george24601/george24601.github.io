* Why we need 3 network calls during init handshake, and 4 to terminate?
* What are possible reasons of many TIME_WAIT? 
* What are possible reasons of many CLOSE_WAIT? 
* Why client needs to wait 2 MSL?
* TCP congestion control, how is it done? How does tcp decide there is congestion?
* Suppose A and B established connection with no data sent, and then B restarts, what is the state of conneciotn on A? How to get rid of/move on from this state?
* full conneciton q (timed resend syn+ ack, forces the client to think the original ACK is lost, so just retry) vs half connection q
* When C starts first handshake but S is unable to process, what does S return?
