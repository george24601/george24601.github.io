NIO model: Multiple channel -> one selector -> SelectionKey queue -> thread pool
* Channel is similar to a abstraction of file descriptor. It is bi-directional, but can asyncly read and write buffer
* One selector to monitor mutliple channels, and we check the selector directly
* Buffer is commonly memory mapped so we don't have to copy from kernel space to user space
* SelectionKey class states 
  * Connect – when a client attempts to connect to the server. Represented by SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT
  * Accept – when the server accepts a connection from a client. Represented by SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT
  * Read – when the server is ready to read from the channel. Represented by SelectionKey.OP_READ
  * Write – when the server is ready to write to the channel. Represented by SelectionKey.OP_WRITE

NIO itself is a case of the reactor model: mutliple Client -> one accepter -> mulitple channel -> one reactor --> multiple servers
