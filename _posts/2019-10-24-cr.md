* Don't try to solve the problem that is not the in the scope, that is, does not need to solve it now
* Focus most on the overall design
* Compliment people in CR, espeically a good answer
* Priorities in order: message format/schema, tests, interface, implementation
* Claimed by speed must be backed by microbenchmarks
* Approve the CL as long as it improves the overall health of the code base, even if it is not perfect. 
  * If hard to approve CR, people will be less motivated to make improvements
  * Don't require author to polish every piece of CL before the approval
* Reviewer is the owner of the code they are reviewing
* Favor the authoer's approach if the author can prove it by qualitive or quantitive proofs
* If something is off track early, send feedback immediately
* Review CR as soon as you are not in the middle of a focused task, no more than 1 business day in any case.
* Most deadlines are soft. Favor code quality over meeting soft deadline.  Hard deadline include
  * Contract
  * Market share speed
  * Missing an importatnt conference (debatable)
* Can reject CL just because it is too large. 
  * Leave refactoring in a separate CL whenever possible. 
  * Small cleanup can be in the same CL
  * May do a refactor CL before the implementation 
* If review is not constructive or polite, explain in person. Use private email to explain in a kind way that what you wish could have been done differently
