* Try to keep only ONE owner who is also the decision maker. Decision by committee is OK if it is weighted 
  * Make sure input provider feels heard. Record people's inputs and decisions
  * After that, vote with weights, privately, and the whole team will commit to the decision
  * The team should agree on for long they will commit the decision before revisiting it. The decision maker has an emergency button to revisit it sooner
  * Email the minutes to all stakeholders. In the email, include input providers, and each options' pros and cons. 
* Avoid the analysis paralysis
  * Have a deadline by which the decision has to make.
  * Don't wait for the complete info to arrive 
* Delegate the decision making to someone on the team if possible.
  * If you are OK with whatever decision the delegate makes
  * Once done so, try not to override the decision in the last minute, which is a sign it should not be delegated!
* The approver does not veto on decision itself, but on the quality of the decision
