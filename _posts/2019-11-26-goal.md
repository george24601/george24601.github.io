[The Stretch Goal Paradox](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-stretch-goal-paradox)

* Stretch goal means diffculty and/or novel. Note that a series of small wins itself do not lead to stretch goals, because path to stretch goal is uncertain, and can be broken down up front. However, small wins build the resources, energy, and learning needed for stretch gaols
* Slack resources + recent wins = stretch goal. Be self-disruptive
* no resource + recent wins = small wins with incremental successes. 
* slack resources + recent loss = experiement for small losses,i.e., mildly risky experiments. This builds resillence and confidence in the org
* no resource + recent loss = small wins with incremental successes. However, orgs in such states are most likely to use stretch goals
* Slack resources has be conciously built. One way is to focus on learning to enchance existing resources
