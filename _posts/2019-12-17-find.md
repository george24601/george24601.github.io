* Wait for problems before you introduce solutions (esp. processes or infrastructure)
* Your boss expects you to give input on what should be worked on. Use your down time to research that
* If you hear other teams complaining on a problem, don't bringing in the solution yourself. Wait until they raise it, or inform that team's manager, and let him decide 
* Need to convince all stakeholder they want you to solve this problem. This buy-in process will take a while. If it is too tiring, then maybe you should not solve it
* If you find a problem in another team with clear examples, and they are not able to address it to your satisfaction, it is time to escalate to your manager, but not before that. 
* Solving unowned problem is fun from time to time, but should not be normal - you are not following the right company/boss
* To build trust, teach your team how to show work, and fix how to give feedback
* Talking to customers directly is more effective than any observation data. Observation data needs formal process for evalutaion
* To affect opinions of people, not only the person himself, but also whoever that can directly affect the said person too. Build common interest between the people around the authority
