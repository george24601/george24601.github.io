* Start from easier ones, e.g., Spring Boot
* Read the dependency first, e.g., kafka -> zookeeper -> java.concurrent
* Create a hello world, add debug points. Go top-down upfront only after you are familiar with the codebase
* Try NOT to understand every single line, just focus on the most important flow
* Draw graph
* Need to repeat this a few times to trully understand it
