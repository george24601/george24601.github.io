Reading notes on the essay of same name by Peter Drucker

* Most self-evaluation on one's own strength and weakness are not reliable - has to go through proper try-feedback loop over some time, AT LEAST couple of months
* Focusing on improving strength instead of weakness 
* Things need to figure out on people, again, NOT by self-evaluation:
 * Reader or listener, i.e., needs preparation or on the spot
 * Work with people or alone?
 * Advisor or decision maker?
 * Under stress or predicative environment?
 * Big corporation or small one?
* When short term results are in conflict with long-term growths. A company's value will determine the priority
* A Plan > 18 months is hard to stay clear and specific
* The key to up-management is to understand in which your boss works in the most efficient way, and adjust to that
* Communicate with your 360 clearly:
  * This is what I am good at. 
  * This is how I work. 
  * These are my values. 
  * This is the contribution I plan to concentrate on and the results I should be expected to deliver
  * And ask them the same thing (NOT via plain self-evaluation though!)
* The existence of trust between people does not necessarily mean that they like one another. It means that they understand one another
* Don't try hard to change people's behaviors
