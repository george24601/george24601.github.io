Notes on "Never Split the Difference" by Christopher Voss and Tahl Raz.

Run into this type a lot in Tokyo

* Time spend communicating is a sign of building relationship, which they value
* Ask what/how questions to let them trasnlate talk to implementation. This lets the counterpart feel you need their intelligence to overcome the problem and they have the control on defining success. Such feeling appeals much to people with egos. It also makes people feel it is THEIR idea.
  * Avoid binary questions
  * Avoid when/where questions which can be answered without too much thinking
  * Avoid why questions, because it is easy to trigger people into fight or flight mode
  * Concretely, AFTER they agree with something for the first time. Label and summarize their answer to get a "that's right", and follow up with a what/how questions
    * "What do you see as being the most difficult thing"
    * "What is the biggest challenge you face?"
    * "What is the success measure" 
    * "how will we know we are on track" 
    * What about this is important to you?
    * How can I help to make this better for us?
    * How would you like me to proceed?
    * What is it that brought us into this situation?
  * How can we solve this problem?
  * Whatâ€™s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?
  * How am I supposed to do that?
     * "how do we address things if we are off-track"
* Communicating is good sign, and slience suggests angry
* Easy to be distracted and not good time manager
* Hesitation comes more often in tone and body language, and NOT in words
* Accommodators are more likely to oversell/overpromise.
