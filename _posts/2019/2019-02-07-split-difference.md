Notes on "Never Split the Difference" by Christopher Voss and Tahl Raz.

* Try NOT to speed up process to get a "Yes", very easy to leave the impression that you are ignoring yourcounter counterpart. 
* Avoid direct/assertive voice - easy to put people into defensive mode. Use a positive/playful voice by default
* Try to trigger "No" from counter part, so that the other part feels safe. You can force a "No" by mislabelling
  * If very hard for the counterpart to say "No", just walk away, it is too early
* When you talk about numbers, use precise, odd ones to so that it APPEARS to be thought after
* SLOW DOWN
* NEVER use "I understand"
* Liar is more likely to use longer sentences, third-party pronoun, and more complex sentences
* Use the other side's own name - they want to be called!
* The more I, me, my one uses, the less impact one has in decision making. Other questions to identify deal-breakers:
  * How does this affect the rest of them?
  * How on board are people with this call?
  * What do your team see as the main challenge in this area?
* Labelling, which works well against analyst such as myself
  * It seems/looks/sounds like... DO NOT use I, otheriwse it looks like you are self-centered!
  * pause 3-4 secs
  * Rinse and repeat
  * I didn't say that is the actual case, I just said it seems that.
* Anger shows your passion, but reduces your counterpart's congintive activity due to the emotional mode. You can de-escalate by proposing a time-out. Try to calm emotion before listing theories and facts
* Something doesn't make sense means chance to discover unknowns! Best discovered during face-to-face communications, near breaks or meeting ends. Hard to discover during emails
* The word "fair" is often used so the other side goes defensive and gives concessions. Common cases:
  * We just want what is fair -> OK I am sorry, let us get back to where the fair part begins
  * We have given you a fair offer -> Mirror: Fair? + Label: It seems that you have evidence to support it.
  * Powerful: Stop me at any time if you feel I am being unfair
* List the worst thing the other side could say and say them first, this will encourage the counterpart to say what the opposite is true
* When you sell yourself to the manager, sell yourself as ways to prove their own intelligence and that they can broadcast to the rest of the company, i.e., you are the proof of HIS importance, let him have a stake in your success
* Power Sales Negotiators know that splitting the difference does not mean splitting it down the middle. Just split the difference twice and the split becomes 75 percent/25 percent. Furthermore, you may be able to get the other party to split the difference three or more times.
* The first thing to remember is that you should never offer to split the difference yourself, but always encourage the other person to offer to split the difference.
