One example is how kafka handles it.

* Acceptor thread accepts connections, and pass them to processor threads.
* Each processor thread select() on multiple connections, i.e., the sync event demultiplexer in the textbook reactor pattern.
* On each event, processor sends the arriving requests to the request queue.
* Pooled worker threads will fetch from the request queue and process it. Note implicitly, the queue and its maintainance logic acts as the dispatcher.
* Woker thread puts the response to each processor's response queue.
* Processor thread gets result from its own response queue and answer the client.
