This is a personal list based on web sources, order by my priority. As an interviewer, be prepared to answer these questions or you can sell your company as part of the answers.

### Easy questions
* How do people share learnings? How often?
* What is the hardest part of the job?
* Whatâ€™s your favorite part about working at the company?
* What motivated you to join the organisation?

### Tough questions
* How to define the success of this role 6 months into the job?
  * How is performance measuring done? 
  * Who are the stakeholders of the metrics? 
  * How often are reviews conducted?
* What is the need behind hiring for this role? 
  * What happened to the last person in this role?
* From background/resume, what parts would make you doubt i would be a great fit for the company?
* I have read that you have just launched x. What will that mean for the growth of this role?
