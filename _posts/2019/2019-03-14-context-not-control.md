* It is OK not to please the boss, it is not OK not to serve the business. Information hiding is unacceptable
* Ideally employees do not guess what the manager wants and executes on that decision
* Employees need to learn filter only relevent topics due to the rich contextual information
* Values are shown by who gets rewarded or let go.

### What should be included in the context

This is where most cross-team discussion should happen.

* Metrics
    * including definition of success
* Assumptions
* Objectives
  * Result oriented. Focus on customer impact.
  * Timeframe/urgency/importance
  * How precise the solution needs to be? No error/can correct errors/experimental
* Clearly-defined roles
    * including key stakeholders, which is manager's job to figure out

### What should be avoided

* Top-down decision making
* Management approval, or managers make technical decisions for the team
* Committes
* Cross team discussion on tactics. Each team should be able to execute tactics without management approval
