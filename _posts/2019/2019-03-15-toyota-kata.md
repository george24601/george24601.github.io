### Understand desired direction
* Set up a vision on how work should be done in an ideal state. Process focused and NOT outcome focused, i.e., not a business vision
* Example for software engineering:
  * Zero defects
  * Every check-in to production
  * Highest value first, on demand
  * Motivated people
* Higher level's target condition becomes next level's vision

### Grasp current position
* Collect process metrics AND outcome metrics

### Set the next challenge/target condition 
* Focus on process instead of outcome
* Should take one step closer to the vision AND slight above your current knowledge threshould ("Frugality")
* based on the current condition - should be in absolute numbers
* Set expiry date 1-3 months
* Use hyphothese - experiment - compare prediction and actual outcome to move forward to the target condition.

Repeatedly move to new target condition until you reached the vision
