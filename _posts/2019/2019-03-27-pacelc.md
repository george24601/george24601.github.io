Note that C,A, and P mean very specific things in this context

* C: all nodes see the same data at the same time, as if exeuting on a single node
  * This definition is different from the C in ACID
* A: every request to ANY NON-FAILED node must return a response if it is successful or failure
  * Node failure is outside the scope of CAP!
  * Returning failure still gives A
* P: network is allowed to lose any messages from one node to another. 
  * Note this does not mean packet loss, in the proof they use a TCP-ish protocol already. However, from a node's perspective you can not distinguish between a failed node and partitioned node
  * Retrying communication indefinitely is in essence choosing C over A.

trivial CP system: ignore all requests, return "no result" => Not being available at all is enough to be CP

trivial AP system: return v0 to all requests

If we want to implement any consistency, the only option is to kill paritioned nodes

It is possible it is none of CP, AP, or CA!

### 2PC

* CP? not consistent
* AP? not available, because we can not do any multi-node action
* Not even CA in this sense 
  * what if master failed? the view is not consistent!
  * When master failed and prepared, all slaves are locked)
  * A common CA solution is the full strict quorum control

### Paxos
* AP? no when the link to the leader is cut. Note AP protocols in general need conflict resolution
* CA? because it is async model, so liveness can not be guaranteed

Network partitions are too likely to happen, so CA is useless in practice, Else (E),  when P is not happening, the system should ideally have the perfect CA, i.e., the trade-off between C and latency(L).

If a system chooses to provide C over A in the presence of P, it can:
* refuse to respond to some requests, e.g., don't write in two phase commit
* shutdown entirely
* Only r/w if the data's master node is inside the partitioned component

Most systems don't need atomic consistency or perfect availability during P.
