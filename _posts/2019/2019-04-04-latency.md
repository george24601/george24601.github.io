* Percetile and average metrics are very misleading, although they are good ways to tell stories. Rely on histrogram instead if possible.
  * Double spikes distribution often the sign of multple behaviorial groups 
  * The "shoulder" of the gamma distribution often a sign of a small but separate behaviorial groups
  * Use geometric means for multiplication problems, and harmonic mean for speeds, e.g., when speed s1 for t1 and speed s2 for t2.
* Due to number of requests to serve a single user, even good 99.9% percentile means pretty likely your user will hit a bad latency 
* Max latency carries a lot of weight in showing problems. At the same time, Performance degradation easily got muffled in avg metrics
* A better qustion to ask during performance testing is, while maintaining my SLO, what is the max throughput I can achieve?
* What you measured is often response time instead of service time. Due to queueing and bufffering, customers may experience latency while you do not see it on your monitor.
