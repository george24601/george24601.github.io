* Change energy depleting behavior! Reduce fight or flight case if you can! It will reduce the ability of thiking clearly 
* Lower energy also means harder to manage emotion. Note that not feeling positively means people will not be able to perform well
* Small meals along with day, once every 3 hours
* The energy cycle is between 90 to 120 mins
* Express appreciation to other is also a way to regain energy. The more specific the appreciation, the better
* Deep inhale and exhale, 5-6 second is effect way to defuse
* To gain positivity, ask
  * What the other side in this conflict would say and in what ways might it be true
  * How do I view this situation in 6 month?
  * How do I learn and grow from it, regardless of outcome
* Try not to answer email or phone during your true focus session, check the email only during fixed time:w
* Identify the most important task the NIGHT before work
* To ask people to the top two work experiences where they find they are in their sweet spots. Then deconstruct them to find the motivating factor. 
  * However, defining value often too predictive. Instead, ask what people dislike!
* Schedule relaxation and fun activities and stick to it, even if you think you don't need it! Double the break you think need!
* For every 30 mins of focused work, take 10 mins break. Note that each person has difference attention span. Identify your own!
* Detailed daily plan demotivates people.
