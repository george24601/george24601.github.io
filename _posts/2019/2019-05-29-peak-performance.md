My reading notes

* The team falls back to the lowest common denominator in terms of attitude. How important to purge them!
* Do not use outcome as the driver of bettering yourself
* Turn OFF social media while focusing. Even a phone on the desk will distract us - stow them away!
* Make stress phase about 5% above your current level. More you will get anxiety, less bored
* Social media and tvs are NOT good relaxation techinques. You need to zone out, check out, instead of doing endorphin-inducing activities. 
  * For knowledge workers, excercising is a good way to relax.
  * Social interactions with friends is also a good way, but not with your colleagues 
  * Walking breaks every hour
* Deep breathing may not always work, instead, view stress as challenge instead of threat.
* The less we think about ourselves, the better we perform
* When your mind is not at peace or in a bad mood, hard to think creatively. Therefore, be mindful of what happened to other people's life outside work - this will affect how they react too. 
  * Separating work and life's influence on each other is impossible 
* Even top performers are not able to focus more than 2 hours in one sitting
* Napping can not make up for the lack of REM sleep, but short nap (15-20 mins) good ways to replenish energy in a long and intense day
* Making decision takes energy, even the slightest ones
* Discomfort is a natural part of stress. Learn to separate yourselve from it
* If you check your phone every couple of minutes, then you need a break!
* Fatigue spills over tasks
