```java
static final class Node{
        volatile int waitStatus;
        volatile Node prev;
        volatile Node next;
        volatile Thread thread;
        Node nextWaiter; //for the condition queue
}

//the implementation uses CAS-volatile pattern heavily
class AbstractQueuedSynchronizer  {
        public void acquire(int arg) {
                if(!tryAcquire(arg) && acquireQueued(addWaiter(Node.EXCLUSIVE), arg))
                        selfInterrupt(); //if the thread has been interrupted during the wait, it won't respond, here we do a self-interrupt to make up for it
        }

        public void acquireShared(int arg){
                if(tryAcquireShared(arg) < 0)
                        doAcquireShared(arg);
        }

}

```

* Internally, maintains a volatile int state and CLH, and head + tail
* When acq, state++ if current thread id same as owner id, state-- upon release
* When failed to acq, AQS will ad the current thread's reference and waiting state to the end of Q as Node, and block current thread. Everytime we add to CLH, we need to CAS to set tail to the new node
* Difference with fair and biased: on biased, CAS to acq first, and acq only when failed, and won't detect if CLH is idle
* Shared lock: when it becomes head, it will wake up the next thread, upon releasing, S lock will wake up other threads regardless of state, but X lock will wake up only when state = 0
* for X lock, each node CAS checks if the previosu node is header, if so, try to acquire lock
* ReentrantLock is just an encapsulation of AQS: it has a Sync object which extends AQS
* CountDownLatch: state set to N, at each countDown(), state will CAS to dec by 1, when state= 0, unpark the main thread
