* Approve the CL as long as it improves the overall health of the code base, even if it is not perfect. 
  * If hard to approve CR, people will be less motivated to make improvements
  * Don't require author to polish every piece of CL before the approval
  * The senior principle among all of the code review guidelines.
* Just keep in mind that if your comment is purely educational, but not critical to meeting the standards described in this document, prefix it with “Nit: “ or otherwise indicate that it’s not mandatory for the author to resolve it in this CL.
* Any purely style point (whitespace, etc.) that is not in the style guide is a matter of personal preference. The style should be consistent with what is there. If there is no previous style, accept the author’s.
* If the author can demonstrate (either through data or based on solid engineering principles) that several approaches are equally valid, then the reviewer should accept the preference of the author. Otherwise the choice is dictated by standard principles of software design.
* You can validate the CL if you want—the time when it’s most important for a reviewer to check a CL’s behavior is when it has a user-facing impact, such as a UI change. It’s hard to understand how some changes will impact a user when you’re just reading the code. For changes like that, you can have the developer give you a demo of the functionality if it’s too inconvenient to patch in the CL and try it yourself.
* Encourage developers to solve the problem they know needs to be solved now, not the problem that the developer speculates might need to be solved in the future. The future problem should be solved once it arrives and you can see its actual shape and requirements in the physical universe.
* Compliment people in CR, especially a good answer
* At Google, we optimize for the speed at which a team of developers can produce a product together, as opposed to optimizing for the speed at which an individual developer can write code.
* If you are in the middle of a focused task, such as writing code, don’t interrupt yourself to do a code review.
* to be sure that you are always making comments about the code and never making comments about the developer. You don’t always have to follow this practice, but you should definitely use it when saying something that might otherwise be upsetting or contentious. For example:
  * Bad: “Why did you use threads here when there’s obviously no benefit to be gained from concurrency?”
  * Good: “The concurrency model here is adding complexity to the system without any actual performance benefit that I can see. Because there’s no performance benefit, it’s best for this code to be single-threaded instead of using multiple threads.”
* If you ask a developer to explain a piece of code that you don’t understand, that should usually result in them rewriting the code more clearly. Occasionally, adding a comment in the code is also an appropriate response, as long as it’s not just explaining overly complex code.
* Explanations written only in the code review tool are not helpful to future code readers. They are acceptable only in a few circumstances, such as when you are reviewing an area you are not very familiar with and the developer explains something that normal readers of the code would have already known.
* Experience shows that as more time passes after a developer writes the original CL, the less likely this clean up is to happen. In fact, usually unless the developer does the clean up immediately after the present CL, it never happens. This isn’t because developers are irresponsible, but because they have a lot of work to do and the cleanup gets lost or forgotten in the press of other work. Thus, it is usually best to insist that the developer clean up their CL now, before the code is in the codebase and “done.” Letting people “clean things up later” is a common way for codebase to degenerate.
* If you previously had fairly lax code reviews and you switch to having strict reviews, some developers will complain very loudly. Improving the speed of your code reviews usually causes these complaints to fade away.
* Sometimes it can take months for these complaints to fade away, but eventually developers tend to see the value of strict code reviews as they see what great code they help generate. Sometimes the loudest protesters even become your strongest supporters once something happens that causes them to really see the value you’re adding by being strict.
* Priorities in order: message format/schema, tests, interface, implementation
* Claimed by speed must be backed by micro-benchmarks
* Reviewer is the owner of the code they are reviewing
* Favor the author's approach if the author can prove it by qualitative or quantitative proofs
* If something is off track early, send feedback immediately
* Review CR as soon as you are not in the middle of a focused task, no more than 1 business day in any case.
* Most deadlines are soft. Favor code quality over meeting soft deadline. Hard deadline include
  * Contract
  * Market share speed
  * Missing an important conference (debatable)
* Can reject CL just because it is too large. 
  * Leave refactoring in a separate CL whenever possible. 
  * Small cleanup can be in the same CL
  * May do a refactor CL before the implementation 
* If review is not constructive or polite, explain in person. Use private email to explain in a kind way that what you wish could have been done differently
