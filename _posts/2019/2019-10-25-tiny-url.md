Generate new URL:

* Brute force hash won't work because we want to keep the URL short
* hash of (snowflake id + salt) - need to do base conversion, e.g., from decimal to 62-based
  * Similarly, we can pre-generate short URL by hash of incremental id, and assign to the incoming long URL request
* MurmurHash 

Need to persist:

* past long -> short mappings for look up
* past short mapping for conflict check. 
 * We can also solve it by a unique index on the short url 
 * Bloomfilter to detect obviously new ones - 1B set consumes about 125M 

The server can return either 301 (perm redir) or 302 (temp redir). The difference is that if the client will cache the redirectly result
