New URL = hash of (snowflake id + salt)

Such correspondence may be expensive, may consider cache hot ones in kv store, key being long URL, V being short URL

Can request max numbers in batches from DB

Can use multiple number allocate with fixed steps

The server can return either 301 (perm redir) or 302 (temp redir). The difference is that if the client will cache the redirectly result
