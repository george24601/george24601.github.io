Why redis uses skiplist instead of RBT to implemnt sorted list? interval search, easier to implemnt

### Eviction
* 3.0 maintain a candidate pool of size 16, a top K least recent visited entries
* Strict LRU nees a LL which introduces concurrency and size issue. That is why redis uses a 24 bit TS to implement near LRU
* The eviction process continous if expiration ration > 1/4

### Defense against stampede

* If we want to update from the client side, i.e., don't want a separate process to update cache entries, options: 
  * Set a mutex key (SETNX), load db, and set the cache. Otherwise, retry the whole get cache method
  * Alternatively, inside value itself set a timeout value to1, when we read the cache and find it already expired, we extend timeout1, and reset it on cache. This way, others still think it is safe to use the cache.
  * Do not set expiring time, but store the logical value inside the value, if we find it is about to expire, use a background thread to update construct the value asyncly
* Still need to combine with rate-limiting + active standby cluster to defense in depth.
