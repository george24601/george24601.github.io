LISTEN FIRST, SPEAK LAST

### Ask "What needs to be done?"

* NOT "What do I want to do?". Not asking it almost always gurantees wrong decision
* Focus on ONLY one urgent task at a time
  * After it is done, re-eval priorities instead of the moving on to the second most urgent

### Develop action plans

* Action plan states intention but not commitment. Even if it is written, should expect to revisit and revise often
* Organizations are time-wasters in nature
* Most likely you don't stick with the original plan, but without planning, you become a prisoner of events. Also need regular check-in to figure out which ones truly matter

### Responsible for decision

* A decision must have all stakeholders and their precision roles in the decision
  * Also a deadline must be included
* Hiring/promoting is often the most difficult decision. Expect 1/3 success rate, and revisit people decision after 6 months. 
  * Even if it is a failure, it is the exec's mistake, not the failed person, BUT this person has to be removed - offer them to go back to the original level
* On weak areas, delegate

### Focus on oppurtunities than problems

* How can we exploit this change for the company?
* List and deal with oppurtunities first, problems next
* Put best people on oppurtunities than problems.

### Run productive meetings

* Make sure all participants agree on why the meeting is happening
* Don't sign up for committee meetings
* Don't brainstorm together. Brainstorm offline, and use meeting to review and eval the ideas. People should feel free to criticize DURING the meeting
* MAKE SURE decide what kind of meeting it will be, each needs different preparation and results
  * Preparing statement or announcement: one member comes up with draft before the meeting. At the end of the meeting, a pre-pointed member will distribute the final text
  * Annoucement,e.g., org changes: annoucemnet and discussion about it only
  * One member reports: nothing but the report should be discussed
  * A few member reports: No discussion, or questions for clarification only, or discussion where all participants ask questions. In this case, distribute report before the meeting, and timebox it (e.g., 15 mins)
  * Inform the exec: Exec should listen and ask questions, he should sum up but not making the presentaion
  * Meeting just to be in exec's presence: lunch/dinner format ONLY
* Designate someone to take notes in the meeting.
* Sloan's meeting method
  * Annouce the purpose
  * Listen and only clarify points
  * Sum up what to be included in the memo at the end of each disscussion point or end of meeting
  * Immediately followed by an after-meeting memo, which summarized discussions, conclusions, and action items/assignments/deadline. This memo is cced to every participants 
* Too many meetings means the responsibility is too decentralized. In a lean org, people should be able to move around without collsion and explaining their work all the time. Otherwise, the org is overstaffed
