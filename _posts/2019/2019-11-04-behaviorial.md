[From hire by google](https://hire.google.com/articles/7-proven-job-interview-questions/)

### For interviewer

* Identify workflow, are you able to learn tools/ways from the candidate?
* How do they deal with problems that are bound to happen in the work
* Alternatively, "Describe your process for [a major part of the job]


### My answers

The most important part is to get stakeholders, most likely from different teams, to agree on the context section of the design doc. 

This agreement includes:

* Background data. People should agree that the data is correct, even if they disagree on how to interpret it
* Assumptions. the data should be correct
* Goals. Customer-facing impacts, no more than 3 points. Also, 1-3 metrics to evaluate if the goal is achieved
* Non-goals. Out of scope work items
* Roles. Owner, reviewer, approver, affected
* Cross team impact
* DAG and high level time estimate. 
* How often we revisit and update the context? Normally weekly

This agreement does NOT include

* Solution candidates
* Detailed scope and timeline for each item
* Internal metrics to monitor/alert
