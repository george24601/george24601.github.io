* Have to be interested in people when face-to-face
* Start with your own shortcoming and the counterpart's supriority before criticizing
* Quick feedback loop!
* Specific details when you compliment
* Give people a fine reputation they live up to. Use titles and responsibilities as toys for people that they want to own
* Always makes people happy doing what you suggest. What benefit will they gain from doing what you suggest?
* Rejecting people is OK, but see if you can provide an alternative solution at the same time
* Avoid insult, ridicule, criticize in most cases - they are just not productive. (On a side note, i see so many people violating this by trying to be funny)
* Use the person's first name as much as you can
* Do not tell other people you are wiser than them
* Don't teach people, guide them to find it within himself
* Presenting facts in a vivid, dramatic way with multiple senses
