Notes form HBR review articles
* What we can learn from Japanese Management
* How to negotiate in Japan

### Working with interpretors
* If possible, share the draft doc/presentation beforehand
* Loudly and slowly, use simple words
* Explain the same idea in 2-3 different ways as checksum
* 30 secs break to let interpretors go
* Number is easy to mistranslate, write it down if possible
* Do not interrupt interpreters
* Use positive form instead of negative wording. Also avoid double negatives
* Use body movements

* Japanese decision process is very democratic - ringi means buying in from all stakeholders, instead of LCA of those stakeholders. (I got burned by the slow process many time)
* When the negotiation is stuck, keep the channel open and ping from time to time
* Ask Japanese lower levels for more info on friends and enemies (nemawashi?)
