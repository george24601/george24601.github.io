### Requirements
* Data consistency
* How long it takes to discover offline service?
* How many service instances can it support?
* How many machines you need to run this registry?

### Eureka
* P2P, all provides to outside services, when it is registred on node, it will be gossiped to other nodes
* ReadOnly default sync time is 30 sec. Service refreshes on 30 sec interval
* Default: Every 60 sec to detect offline service. Heartbeat expires at 90 sec
