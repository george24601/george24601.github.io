### [C - Candles](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc107/tasks/arc101_a)
ans = dist between ends + min distance from either end

### [C - Strange Bank](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc099/tasks/abc099_c)
* No need for memorization. Note in knapsack solution, we just need >= and A[0] instead of checking >
* TODO

### [C - String Transformation](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc110/tasks/abc110_c)
We can prove that the transformation retains the isomorphism if it starts with one. so we can just verify that final mapping is an isomorphism

### [C - K-th Substring](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc097/tasks/arc097_a)

* Brute force won't work because it will be s ** 2  substrings
* K no more than 5 means that the top K answer will not be longer than 5 anyway. Otherwise, we can reduce the length of the answer and improve it
* So we just sort all 25000 strings, each with length 5

### [C - Factors of Factorial](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc067/tasks/arc067_a)
Calcuate the prime factorization of each number and then build the divisor by the PRODCUT of numbers

### [D - Rain Flows into Dams](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc133/tasks/abc133_d)
Since it is odd, we can do the odd - even trick and sum up together
