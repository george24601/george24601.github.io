[the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/02/26/meaningful-availability/)

* ELB default health check timeout is 10 sec, which is overly generious for the same region case. Normally 2 second timeout with 3 attempts to declare failure is enough
* Otherwise, by default, the instance will be taken offline at least 30 seconds after the failure happens, with traffic still directed to the faulty instance. 
* Problem with time-based availability metrics: MTTF / (MTTF + MTTR) 
  * In distributed systems, common to have part of it failed somewhere, how do you define "down"? 
  * How do you differentitate the impact of down during off hour and peak hour
* Problem with count-based availability metrics: % of successful requests
  * High volume user has higher impact on this metric
  * Less traffic will come when user preceives the system is down, which makes it look better than it actually is
  * Not showing how long a system is down 
* Both metrics above do not capture the down time pattern and different durations of outages
* The longer the time window, the "better" availability metric appears
