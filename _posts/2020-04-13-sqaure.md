[Original discussion](https://tianpan.co/notes/167-designing-paypal-money-transfer#payment-service)

### High level components

* API gateway
* Auth module
* Payment service records txns seen by the user
  * txn, status, may have a list of ledger entries 
* Book keeping ledger service, keeps track of internal states 
  * use double book keeping, i.e., need to differentiate debit and credit
  * Need to know which entry maps to which txn
* Account balance service for users
  * May merge this as part of the ledger if distributed txn is not desirable
* Proxy to 3rd party payment and settlement
* MQ for the async notification from the main txn system

### Requirement: our internal txn state should be consistent with external txn state

* Recon job to scan pending txns after a period
* provide webhook for 3rd party to ack success

### Requirement: users may pay in different currencies

* Introduce a centralized exchange service
* Ledger keeps the currency and the original amount, with the rate recorded
* Need extra ledger entry for internal txns
