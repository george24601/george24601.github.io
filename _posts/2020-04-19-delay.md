The purpose of delayed task is to execute some task in the the future

Common solutions:
* DelayQueue
* ScheduledExecutorService
* zset in redis with activation time as key, need to check if deletion is successful to see if it is consumed multiple times
* Use key space notification (Default is off in redis)

The key algo is the timer wheel

Now suppose our delayed task is per user instead of per event type/trigger. How do you design this?
