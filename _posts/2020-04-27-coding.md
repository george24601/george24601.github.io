All space requirements here include the stack space for recursive call

* Given two list of customer ids as the sequence placing orders, and a third list of serving orders. Test if ids each list are first-come first served
  * Custom orders may duplicate. O(n) time, O(1) space
* Given an undirected graph with maximum degree D, find a graph coloring using at most D+1 colors, as minimum color as possible 
* Write a function that takes as an input a list of sorted lists and outputs a single sorted list with all the items from each list.
* Given a number with N digits, we want to remove K digits so that the remaining digits form the max number possible.  O(N) runtime with O(1) space. Do not modify the given string
* Given a string S, what the min number of character we append at either end to make it a palindrome. Solve it in O(len(S))
* Matrix labelled with 0 and 1s. Find the largest square labelled with 1. O(n^2) runtime, and O(n) space
* Given an array of integers. Find the max difference between consecutive integers in the sorted array. O(n) time
