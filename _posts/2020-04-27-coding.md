All space requirements here include the stack space for recursive call

* Write a function that takes as an input a list of sorted lists and outputs a single sorted list with all the items from each list.
* Given a number with N digits, we want to remove K digits so that the remaining digits form the max number possible.  O(N) runtime with O(1) space. Do not modify the given string. Solve it in two different ways
* Given a string S, what the min number of character we append at either end to make it a palindrome. Solve it in O(len(S))
* Matrix labelled with 0 and 1s. Find the largest square labelled with 1. O(n^2) runtime, and O(n) space
* Given an array of integers. Find the max difference between consecutive integers in the sorted array. O(n) time
* Takes an array with duplicates. Output all distinct permutation in lexicographical order. Solve it both recursively and iteratively. Runtime O(output size)
  * A variant: Given an N, generate all arrays of size N, such that elemenets are positive, and each distinct value bewteen 1 and the max value in the array appears at least once
* Given N ppl, each with a name and a team (blue or red). Sort the ppl s.t.
  * all blue team are in front of the red team
  * relative order in the original array is maintained, i.e., sorting is stable
  * O(NlogN) with O(1) memory
* Compute X^Y. X is a real number, Y is integer. Solve it both recursively and iteratively
