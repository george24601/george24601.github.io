* Store : each tikv server maps to a store
* Pending: learner/follower log lags behind leader by a large margin
* PD use standard revision + lease for leader failover


* Scheduler: generate the operator, which encapsulates the steps related to rebalancing for a single region,i.e., one region has mutliple steps 
  * balance-leader-scheduler
  * balance-region-scheduler
  * hot-region-scheduler

```go

type Scheduler interface {
	GetName() string
	GetResourceKind() ResourceKind
	Schedule(cluster *clusterInfo) Operator
}
```

After operator is generated, it will be put in a queue and execute sequentially (possibly in parallel), by sending the operator step to the region leader as a response to the heartbeat 
  * It will wait for timeout with ack

```go

type Operator interface {
	GetRegionID() uint64
	GetResourceKind() ResourceKind
	Do(region *regionInfo) (*pdpb.RegionHeartbeatResponse, bool)
}

```
