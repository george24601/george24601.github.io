### Motivation

Range operation on an array that costs O(n), we want to improve to O(sqrt(n)) with O(sqrt(n)) additional memory

### Why each block has size sqrt?

The reasoning is similar to master theorem, i.e., the number of subproblems vs the cost of combining results from subproblems. The worst case is optimized when the two parts of the total cost is equal

### Example

* No write operation, answer abitrary range query, each would cost O(n) without this techinque 
* A mixture of read-write operation, one with O(1) and one O(n). So overall cost will be O(n). After applying the technique the cost will be dropped back to O(sqrt(n)). Often an alternative for segment tree
