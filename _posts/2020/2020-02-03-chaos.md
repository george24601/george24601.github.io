Notes on [this post](https://medium.com/@njones_18523/chaos-engineering-traps-e3486c526059)

* Goal is resilience instead of finding risks
* Don't measure KR by errors discovers - they show only ignorance instead of risk
* Human under pressure IS part of the system to test. Need to optimize how they react
* Focus on things done right rather than pointing out risks. Don't chase the fixes
* Providing context and let service owner decide what to do with the vulnerability
* Automate the discovery of what is wrong, but not what should be
* Manual gamedays and chaos experiements in non-prod env are the prerequisite of prod testing
* Creating experiement often has more value than running them
* Define "steady state" at first
