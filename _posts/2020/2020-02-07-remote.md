* Massive, if not too much, communication need between offices if teams are not autonomous enough
  * Decompose tasks more fine-grained than in the same location
  * Massive communication load during OKR settings for each tasks
* Arrive at 5 mins early to ensure techs are ready and thus, real meeting starts on time
* Host side, have one reponsible identifying remote people who want to speak
* Make explicit overlapping business hours
* Make sure results are visible to everyone
  * daily and weekly review become a must
* Hire ONLY self-driven people
* Project owner needs to have one go-to doc for
  * resources and their owners
  * links to detailed docs
  * current progress and risks
* One wiki parent page for each team
* Each team sends out weekly report, summarized and distilled at each level
* Centralized test logbook, including PoC runs, so that ideas/data can be reused in the future
* Team should meet face to face at least once per OKR period
* Need a doc that holds context for all stake holders
 * Major tasks with owners, progress, impact on the overall progress
 * Fine grained enough to ensure daily update
