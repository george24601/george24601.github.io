* All user data in InnoDB tables is stored in pages comprising a B-tree index (the clustered index). In some other database systems, this type of index is called an “index-organized table”. Each row in the index node contains the values of the (user-specified or system-generated) primary key and all the other columns of the table.
  * Updates to rows usually rewrite the data within the same page
* by default, `innodb_file_per_table` is on. This means each table will have an `ibd` file
  * each ibd file has multiple segments, each of which is associated with an index
  * each segment consists of multiple 1MB extent
  * Each extend has multiple 16KB pages
* On delete, the space of the deleted record is marked reusable, if it reaches MERGE_THRESHOLD (default 50%), innodb will try merging it with neighboring pages, and leave the original page blank.
  * Check `index_page_merge_successful` in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_METRICS`   

### Optimize table

* If you do sequential deletes instead of random deletes, most likely you don't need to run `optimize table`, because
  * [Newly inserted rows will use the space marked for reuse](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/162632/does-mysql-use-deleted-rows-space-in-a-table).
  * innodb automatically [merge empty index pages](http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/how-often-should-you-use-optimize-table-followup)
* Purpose of `optimize table` is to
 * reduce the `data_free` value in `information_schema.tables`. 
 * defrag index pages. 
* `data_free` marks the reusable space, and is not accrurate if the table has variable-length column > 768 bytes,e.g., varchar, text
* Innodb implements `opitmize table` by `alter table force` to use the temp table. This also means additional spaces needed during the operation
