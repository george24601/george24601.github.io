* Estimate how much time you can allocate, and set aside continous time block for it. Each block should be at least one hour
* Structured procastination by working on things important but not urgent
* Checking phone every few minutes is a sign of fatigue, take a break
* Stop when you feel good and know where the direction is going and come back later
* Going through email or discuss on a forum is ineffective by nature. Pre-plan time slot for such activities, ideally at fixed time, and don't worry about it later
* Don't think about money or dispute if possible. They are naturally attention sinks
* Don't think about damage other people have done to you. They don't deserve space in your mind
