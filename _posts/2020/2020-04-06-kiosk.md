Note capacity estimation, storage design, and computation design will keep triggering update of each other

### Requirements

* Each kiosk has multiple delivery boxes, of different dimensions
* When user places an order, the system should return up to 3 possible kiosks that can accept user's delivery
* Handle the NA traffic

### Capacity estimation

* 500 mil NA user, assume each place 1 order at black friday, so peak traffic at 500 mil / 90 k sec per day * 4 = 25 K TPS max
* Each kiosk has 100 boxes, so it can support 1k population, assumption on normal day 10% people buys. So 500K kiosk is more than enough 
* Each kiosk covers a 0.5 mile radius with little overlap

### Storage layer

* Kiosk needs to keep track of:
 * geohash - needs index to range search
 * number of boxes
* Box needs to keep track of
 * dimension (H, L, W)
 * parent kiosk
* Status needs to keep track of 
 * Box to the packages ids, one to many
 * parent kiosk if they are in separate service
* Since kiosk info is rarely updated, kiosk and box info can be in read slaves or cache to scale out read. 

### Computation sequence

* Fetch the nearest 10 kiosk from on of the DB's read slave by range searching on geohash
* Fetch the empty boxes (< 1k total) in those kiosks, and compute in memory possible empty ones, i.e., WLH > the package's WLH
* Return to the user kiosks with empty boxes
