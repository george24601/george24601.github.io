Design a dapper-like system for tracing and monitoring

### Requirements: drill down a certain request and see its sequence of actions

* Embed in the header
  * Trace id: root id
  * Parent session id: who called this request
  * Current session id
  * Seq number to mark layer and de-dup
* Do sampling to control no more than 1k writes per sec
* Can just store them in (traceid, session) -> table
* Upon viewing, just load all sessions in a trace on the fly and compute the tree (< 100 sessions per trace)

### Requirements: calculate avg latency by node id and time

* Timeseries db, similar to the design of prometheus
* For each metric, we maintain (timestamp, machineid, sequence) -> labels, value
* Suppose 100 metrics sent per sec, 3 months data is 100 * 86400 * 100 = 1B data points, so if we want to plot the data over 3 months we need to scan at most 1 bill rows. 
  * It can be parallelized by each point we see on the graph
