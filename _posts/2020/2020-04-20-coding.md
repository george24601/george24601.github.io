All space requirements here include the stack space for recursive call

### [98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/365388903/)
* Multiple ways to do it iteratively

* Second largest item in a BST. O(h) time, O(1) space
* Write an efficient function that tells us whether or not an input string's openers and closers are properly nested, including {,(, ['s AND quotes (")
* Given a list of n+ 1 numbers, each within [1, n], find one integer that appears more than once.
  * Variation 1: returns all duplicates instead of one of them. What is the best we can do
  * Variation 2: O(n) run time with space still O(1), do this without destroying input. Two ways
  * Related: [41. First Missing Positive](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/361721528/)
* You have a function rand7() that generates a random integer from 1 to 7. Use it to write a function rand5() that generates a random integer from 1 to 5. 
  * Follow-up: implement rand7() with rand5(). 
  * Follow-up: prove why deterministic run time is not possible
  * Follow-up: Implmement rand7() with rand10() and vice versa
* Given an undirected graph with maximum degree D, find a graph node coloring using at most D+1 colors, so that no adjacent nodes have the same color

### [871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/341339374/)
* Multiple ideas

### [493. Reverse Pairs](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/341479345/)
* Many corner cases

### [4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/356156488/)
* Many corner cases. My first insight is sightly off and introduced even more cases
* Related [295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/361113610/)
  * My first attempt tries to over-optimize and missed a corner case

### [10. Regular Expression Matching](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/356396270/)
* How to explain it is faster than the backtrack simulation?
* Corner case
