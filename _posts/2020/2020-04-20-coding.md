### Good for whiteboarding
* [143. Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/367617050/)
* Given an undirected graph with maximum degree D, find a graph node coloring using at most D+1 colors, so that no adjacent nodes have the same color

### [Implement Rand10() Using Rand7()](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/371631153/)
  * Multiple ways
  * Follow-up: implement rand7() with rand5(). 

### [98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/365388903/)
* Multiple ways to do it iteratively
* [Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/368098731/)

### [41. First Missing Positive](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/361721528/)
* Given a list of n+ 1 numbers, each within [1, n], find one integer that appears more than once.
  * Variation 1: returns all duplicates instead of one of them. What is the best we can do
  * Variation 2: O(n) run time with space still O(1), do this without destroying input. Two ways
