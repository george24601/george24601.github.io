[ConsumerCoordinator](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/ConsumerCoordinator.java) 

* Fetch thread to pull msgs. 
* Heartbeat thread to the coordinator. Default timeout at 10s (session.timeout.ms)
  * Will get the state of the coordinator, if it is rebalancing, send the JoinGroup request
* Every consumer group has a coordinator on the broker. The coordinator manages the membership of consumers

### Kafka group states

* Empty: init state, no group member
* PreparingBalance
* InitialRebalance: delay entering PreparingBalance state to reduce rebalance times
* AwaitSync: waiting for the new assignment from the group leader
* Stable
* Dead: empty group. Metadata no longer available

When joining new group, the state is Empty -> PreparingBalance -> AwaitSync -> Stable

### Rebalance consumer

When the consumer membership changes, coordinator will rebalance consumer to partition association 
 
* Coordinator replys the heartbeat request from all consumers with rebalance notification. All consumers need to resend joinGroup request
* JoinGroup: When new one joins the group
  * the coordinater will let the consumer group leader know the membership assignment, generaton
  * Other consumers will know the leader, generation  and topic and its partition info
* SyncGroup: after JoinGroup stage is over. Consumer leader will rebalance and return the assignment to the coordinator, which in turn broadcast to other consumers as reponse of SyncGroup call from followers
  * Default assignment strategy is RangeAssignor
* If leader is lost during the rebalance, it will be detected by coordinator and the leader will be removed
