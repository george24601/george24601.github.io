All space requirements here include the stack space for recursive call

* Given a number with N digits, we want to remove K digits so that the remaining digits form the max number possible.  O(N) runtime with O(1) space. Do not modify the given string. Solve it in two different ways
* Matrix labelled with 0 and 1s. Find the largest square labelled with 1. O(n^2) runtime, and O(n) space
* Given an array of integers. Find the max difference between consecutive integers in the sorted array. O(n) time
  * Variation: Find the max and min number out of n numbers. Try to do that with less than 2n-2 comparisions
* Takes an array with duplicates. Output all distinct permutation in lexicographical order. Solve it both recursively and iteratively. Runtime O(output size)
  * A variant: Given an N, generate all arrays of size N, such that elemenets are positive, and each distinct value bewteen 1 and the max value in the array appears at least once
  * [31. Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/361819053/)
  * [47. Permutations II](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/363100192/)
* Given N ppl, each with a name and a team (blue or red). Sort the ppl such that
  * all blue team members are in front of the red team memebers
  * relative order in the original array is maintained, i.e., sorting is stable
  * O(1) memory. N up to 20K
* Given a function return 0,1 at P and 1-P, implement a function that return 0 and 1 with same probability
* Count how many 1 bits in an integer? how about how many 0 bits in an integer?
