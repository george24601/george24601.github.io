### Good for whiteboarding

* [221. Maximal Square](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/366476010/)
  * O(M) extra space
* Given N ppl, each with a name and a team (blue or red). Sort the ppl such that
  * all blue team members are in front of the red team memebers
  * relative order in the original array is maintained, i.e., sorting is stable
  * O(1) memory. N up to 20K
* Given a function return 0,1 at P and 1-P, implement a function that return 0 and 1 with same probability
* Count how many 1 bits in an integer? how about how many 0 bits in an integer?
* Given an array of integers. Find the max difference between consecutive integers in the sorted array. O(n) time
  * Variation: Find the max and min number out of n numbers. Try to do that with less than 2n-2 comparisions

### [47. Permutations II](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/363100192/)

* Takes an array with duplicates. Output all distinct permutation in lexicographical order. Solve it both recursively and iteratively. Runtime O(output size)
  * A variant: Given an N, generate all arrays of size N, such that elemenets are positive, and each distinct value bewteen 1 and the max value in the array appears at least once
  * [31. Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/361819053/)

### [780. Reaching Points](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/341192878/)
* Many corner cases

### [44. Wildcard Matching](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/361714655/)
* Corner case

### [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/362865465/)
* First attempt has a bug
