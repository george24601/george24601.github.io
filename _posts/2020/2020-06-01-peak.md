* Surprises in the middle as peak. Rewards/compliment at the end
* Identify the target person you want to influent. His feeling decides the moment's effectiveness
* The effect should align with the expectation, and exceeds expectation
* At the end of the project, do a retro with team and client, to summarize exp and lessons
  * Proved next stage roadmap even if not asked
* Similarly, highest and most recent prices carry more weights in setting internal price benchmark
