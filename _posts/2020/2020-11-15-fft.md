* Eval a polynomical A(x) at x0 : Horner's rule
* Mutlply two polys: 
  * Closed form at O(n^2) naively -> O(nlogn) possible
  * Equivalent to convolution of vectors A * reverse(B) - inner products of all possible shifts
* Poly representations: 
  * Samples for n points with all distince xs. 
     * Convert between this and coefficient form in O(nlogn)
     * Sampling n points takes O(n^2) in total
  * A sequence of n roots
* Eval A(x) for x in X: D&C by even/odd i
  * A(x) = A_even(x^2) + x * A_odd(x^2)
  * Derive the recursion and cost => draw the recursion tree and we see it is still n^2
  * Square a number on the unit circle on the complex plane
* FFT is the d&c algo for DFT (coefficent to sample form)
  * Fast poly multiplicatin: FFT(A) * FFA(B) and then do inverse FFT
