### STAR Method

* One or two sentences per STAR. Easy to have too long/detailed answers when you are stressed
 * 45-60 secs/120-150 words answer. Too short it doesn't cover enough details. Too long it becomes rambling 
 * After the high level STAR, ask the interviewer if need to provide more details
* Situtation: Scene and details of example. Make things as measurable as possible, as the interviewer lacks the context of your mind image.
* Task/Goal: your role/job/goal in the situation. Don't mistake this for Action 
* Action: What YOU did to achieve the goal. Not what YOUR TEAM did, or what you WOULD do.
* Result: need to emphaize on the (ideally measurable) impact of your action. Often this was not done enough by candidates
* Focus on facts and avoid comment/conclusions. If you really need to include comment/conclusions, use the eval from the third party, not yourself.

### Tell me about a time you took a risk and failed. 
* Defind failure definition upfront: not meeting expectation/goal/highest standards(maybe)
* Try not to spend too much time setting the stage, and get to the punch line quickly
* Start with the situation, and explain why it was challenging. Then go into what you specifically did to try and rectify it
* Wrap up with your lessons learned, ideally with postive impacts of this learning to future events

### Tell me about a mistake you've made. 
* How did you handle it?

### Tell me a time where you disagreed and you were wrong

### Describe a time when you struggled to build a relationship with someone important. 
* How did you eventually overcome that?

### Explain a situation in which you disagreed with your manager and how you handled it

### Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. 
* What was going on, and how did you get through it?

### Tell me a time where you disagreed and you were right

### Give me an example of a time when you were able to successfully persuade someone to see things your way at work.

### Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.
