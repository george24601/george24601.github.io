### STAR Method

* Situtation and task, e.g.,
  * Hard project
  * Where you showed persuation and influence
  * Technical skills
* Action YOU TOOK. Not what YOUR TEAM did, or what you WOULD do.
* Result: How does it end?
  * What did you/the project accomplish?
  * What did you learn from it?
* What would you do it differently? What would you wish you have learned before it starts
* What is the most difficult part and how do you solve it?
* Focus on facts and avoid comment/conclusions. If you really need to include comment/conclusions, use the eval from the third party, not yourself.

### Criteria for stories

* Things I have skin in game. Ideally not too long ago < 3 years
* It is OK if stories between questions overlap, but they should be viewed from different dimensions to provide skills evaluated
