### Dos and don'ts

* Goal is to attract more attenion, not convincing people to hire you upfront
* Around 30 secs ~ 80 words. No need to recap the entire history. Focus on what matters most
* SLOW DOWN. To fix it, record your speech, but avoid the trap of over-practice. That makes it sound unnatural
* Structure 
  * Who you are, and your background
  * What you do, and your unique selling propostition, i.e., what can you bring to the team
  * What you want to do/Your goals. What you are looking for
* Omit negative/dislike areas
* Use terms based on target audience. Use different pitches for different audiences

### My technical elevator pitch

I am a backend engineer, and I own systems that serve tens of millions of users and thousands of requests per second. I helped write the dominant payment app in Japan from scratch. Now my code processes hundreds of millions of dollars each day. I am also the solution architect that increased the throughput of this payment gateway by a factor of 3. I am excited to take on new challenges with my experience with highly scalable microservices.
