### Chapter 1

* We write a first draft for ourselves; the drafts thereafter increasingly for the reader
* We measure the quality of writing not just by what is objectively on a page, but by the way we feel as we construct new knowledge out of our experience with the words on the page.
* Since a writer usually overestimates how much readers know, a writer should give readers more help than he thinks they need.
* Once a writer expresses actions in nouns, she can then eliminate whatever (usually concrete) agents perform those actions along with those whom the actions affect

### Chaper 2

* When we revise the abstract nouns into verbs expressing actions, when we make their actors the subjects of those verbs and rearrange the events into a chronological sequence, we create a sentence that we could call "clear" because as we read it, it does not confuse us
* Categeories of "unclear" writing
 * "abstract" or "turgid" -  actions expressed in abstract nouns
 * "disjointed" or does not "flow" - Separated parts of the sentences that he should have kept together
 * "too technical" - used words that most of us do not understand
* First, locate the cast of characters and the actions that those characters perform (or are the objects of). If you find that those characters are not subjects and their actions are not verbs, revise so that they are. 
* A quick method is simply to run a line under the first five or six words of every sentence. If you find that (1) you have to go more than six or seven words into a sentence to get past the subject to the verb and (2) the subject of the sentence is not one of your characters, take a hard look at that sentence;
* When you align subjects and characters, verbs and actions, you turn abstract, impersonal, apparently expository prose into a form that feels much more like a narrative, into something closer to a story. 
* We usually feel we are reading prose that is clear, direct, and readable when a writer consistently expresses the crucial actions of her story in verbs and her central characters (real or abstract) in their subjects.
* Most writers of turgid prose typically use a verb not to exÂ­ press action but merely to state that an action exists. 
* When the nominalization follows there is or there are, change the nominalization to a verb and find a subject
* When you find consecutive nominalizations, turn the first one into a verb. Then either leave the second or turn it into a verb in a clause beginning with how or why
* When nominalization is OK
 * The nominalization is a subject referring to a previous sentence 
 * The nominalization names what would be the object of its verb 
 * A succinct nominalization can replace an awkward "The fact that"
 * Some nominalizations refer to an often repeated concept
* When passive is OK
 * we avoid stating who is responsible for an action
 * make your sequence of subjects appropriately consistent, then choose the passive
