Notes from [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY)

### How to start

* Not start with a joke, because people are still zoning in
* Start with empowerment promise. What will people learn in the next hour, 
* Cycling the ideas when you give a talk, because at any given moment someone will be zoning out
* Distiguishing your ideas with someone else's
* Verbal punctuation, to get zoned out people back on track, e.g., review the outline and overall structure
* ask a question and wait a bit for answers
