* Steps in Query Processing: query -> parsing -> RA expressions -> optimizer with stats -> execution plan -> eval engine with data -> output
* Query optimizers use equivalence rules to systematically generate expressions equivalent to the given expression, i.e., heuristic optimization and cost-based optimization
* Frequently used approach: heuristic rewriting of nested block structure and aggregation. Followed by cost-based join-order optimization for each block
* Optimizers often use simple heuristics for very cheap queries, and perform exhaustive enumeration for more expensive queries 
* Push down projection also reduces number of pages since it eliminates columns early
* Heuristics 
 * Consider only left-deep plans
 * Avoid Cartesian products
 * Donâ€™t optimize the entire query at once. Break query into query blocks and optimize one block at a time
   * A query block contains a single SELECT-FROM-WHERE expression as well as GROUP BY, HAVING clauses
