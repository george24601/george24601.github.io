Every norm for vectors or functions or matrices must share these two properties of the absolute value |c| of a number ||cv|| = |c|||v||, ||v + w|| <= ||v|| + ||w||

Euclidean norm, 1-norm, and infinite norm for a vector $||v||_p=(|v_1|^p+...+|v_n|^p)^{1/p}$

$v^Tw=||v||||w||cos\theta$

#### S-norms

Choose any symmetric positive definite matrix S, S-norm $||v||^2_S = v^TSv$, S-inner product: $(v, w)_S = v^TSw$


#### Norms of functions

A function f(x) is a "vector in function space".

For a vector space to be "complete", every converging sequence $v_n$ must have $||v_n - v_\infty|| \to 0$

Banach space. Hilbert space is a Banach space with inner product of $(v,v) = ||v||^2$


#### The Frobenius Norm

A matrix norm follows rules for a vector norm, plus ||AB||<= ||A||||B||

$||A||_F^2 = |a_{11}|^2+...+|a_{mn}|^2$

When Q is an orthogonal matrix, we know that Qx has the same $l^2$ length as x. $||QB||_F = ||B||_F$

$||A||_F^2$ = trace of AT A =sum of eigenvalues

#### Matrix Norms from Vector Norms

If we choose the vector v with the largest growth factor, $||A|| = max(||Av||/||v||)$

l2 norm: largest singular value
l1 norm: largest l1 norm of the columns of A
$l_\infty$ norm: largest l1 norm of the rows of A


#### The Nuclear Norm

Also called the trace norm.  

$||A||_N = \sigma _1 + ... + \sigma _n$. It is the minimum value of $||U||_F||V||_F$ with UV=A

$||A||_F =  \sigma _1^2 + ... + \sigma _n^2$

$||A||_2 = \sigma _1$
