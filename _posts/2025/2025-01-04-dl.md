## Lecture 2 - ML Refresher / Softmax Regression

Supervised learning 
* classification (e.g., spam detection, image recognition) and regression tasks (e.g., predicting house prices, stock forecasting).
* Algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, and linear regression.
* Requires a large amount of accurately labeled data for effective training.

Unsupervised learning
* Useful for clustering (e.g., customer segmentation), association (e.g., market basket analysis), and dimensionality reduction (e.g., principal component analysis, or PCA)
* Algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and autoencoders.
* Can work with unlabeled data, which is often more readily available and cost-effective to collect.

Multi-class classification setting

Matrix batch notation
* X in $R^{m \times n}$
* Matrix ops are more efficient than many vector ops

Loss function: classification error
* $l_{\text{err}}(h(x), y) = 0 \quad \text{if} \quad \text{argmax}_i \, h_i(x) = y$
* bad for optimization, because it is not differentiable

Loss function: softmax/cross-entropy loss
* Softmax(h(x)) = normalize(exp(h(x)))
* $l_ce(h(x), y) = -h_y(x) + log \sum_{j=1}^k exp(h_j(x))$ applied to a linear hypothesis class
* Find \theta that minimizes the average loss of the training set

### SGD

\alpha step size/learning rate
Sample a minibatch of size B, change by \alpha /B

gradient of cross entropy

Hack to compute loss's derivative: pretend everything is vector, and then reaggrange transpose matrices/vectors to make size work. Make sure check the numerical answers. This approach works for the matrix batch form of the loss
