* all-important reminder that we must test our guesses
* Guess and then prove. All great discoveries are done this way
* Finished math consists of proofs, but math in the making/discovery consists of guesses

### How many parts do 5 planes cut

* Students started with random guesses
* Start with easier problems which could help
* A student asked if planes can be parallel, and prompted the clarification that planes are random
* 3 planes give 8
* Think of extreme cases in reasonable guessing
* Guess 4 planes give 16 based on observation of pattern, and then generalize, i.e., induction
* Need to test the guess/prediction
* Use analogy to help guess, what if lines against planes? Turns out 4 lines confine a triangle, and so do 4 plane
* Turns out 3 lines give only 7, which suggests that plane version is incorrect. We could but 1 triangle + 3 side adjecent + 3 vertex adjecent. In plane case, it is 1 finite + 4 faces + 6 cutting edge + 4 points
* Analogy: line divided by points, and then we guessed by induction when we see the pattern with lower dimensions
* Prove the pattern with 5 case is hard, so we try 4 + line case. After we verified the 11 case, we are more confident with the 26 guess.
* Proving the answer is out of scope for this lecture
